NAME
       filter - cups file conversion filter interface

SYNOPSIS
       filter job user title num-copies options [ filename ]

DESCRIPTION
       The CUPS filter interface provides a standard method for adding support
       for new document types to CUPS. Each filter is  capable  of  converting
       from  one  or  more  input formats to another format that can either be
       printed directly or piped into another filter to get it to a  printable
       format.

       Filters  must be capable of reading from a filename on the command-line
       or from the standard input, copying the standard input to  a  temporary
       file  as  required  by  the file format. All output must be sent to the
       standard output.

       The command name (argv[0]) is  set  to  the  name  of  the  destination
       printer but is also available in the PRINTER environment variable.


OPTIONS
       Options passed on the command-line typically do not include the default
       choices the printer's PPD file. In addition, some options may be speci-
       fied  in  multiple  ways  -  "landscape" is a synonym for "orientation-
       requested=4",  "media"  is  a  synonym  for  "PageSize",  "PageRegion",
       "InputSlot",  and "MediaType", and "sides" is a synonym for the various
       "Duplex" options. Non-raster filters must  support  both  explicit  and
       implicit  specification  of  PPD  options - use the ppdMarkDefaults and
       cupsMarkOptions functions in the CUPS library to use the  correct  map-
       ping, and ppdFindMarkedChoice to get the user-selected choice.

       Raster  filters  should  use option choices set through the raster page
       header, as those reflect the  options  in  effect  for  a  given  page.
       Options  specified on the command-line determine the default values for
       the entire job, which can be overridden on a per-page basis.


LOG MESSAGES
       Messages sent to stderr are generally logged  to  printer-state-message
       attribute  and  the current ErrorLog.  Each line begins with a standard
       prefix:


       ALERT: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and  adds  the  specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "alert" log level.


       ATTR: attribute=value [attribute=value]
            Sets  the  named  job attribute(s). Typically this will be used to
            set the job-remote-id attribute.


       CRIT: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and  adds  the  specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "critical" log level.


       DEBUG: message
            Sets  the  printer-state-message  attribute and adds the specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "debug" log level.


       DEBUG2: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and  adds  the  specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "debug2" log level.


       EMERG: message
            Sets  the  printer-state-message  attribute and adds the specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "emergency" log level.


       ERROR: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and  adds  the  specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "error" log level.


       INFO: message
            Sets  the printer-state-message attribute. If the current LogLevel
            is set to "debug2", also adds the specified message to the current
            ErrorLog using the "info" log level.


       NOTICE: message
            Sets  the  printer-state-message  attribute and adds the specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "notice" log level.


       PAGE: page-number #-copies

       PAGE: total #-pages
            Adds an entry to the current PageLog. The first form adds #-copies
            to  the job-media-sheets-completed attribute. The second form sets
            the job-media-sheets-completed attribute to #-pages.


       PPD: Keyword=Value ... KeywordN=Value
            Sets the named keywords in the printer's PPD file. This  is  typi-
            cally  used to update default option keywords such as DefaultPage-
            Size and the various installable options in the PPD file.


       STATE: printer-state-reason [printer-state-reason ...]

       STATE: + printer-state-reason [printer-state-reason ...]

       STATE: - printer-state-reason [printer-state-reason ...]
            Sets, adds, or removes printer-state-reason keywords to  the  cur-
            rent  queue.  Typically  this  is used to indicate media, ink, and
            toner conditions on a printer.


       WARNING: message
            Sets the printer-state-message attribute and  adds  the  specified
            message to the current ErrorLog using the "warning" log level.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables are defined by the CUPS server when

            The default text character set, typically utf-8.


       CLASS
            When a job is submitted to a printer class, contains the  name  of
            the destination printer class. Otherwise this environment variable
            will not be set.


       CONTENT_TYPE
            The MIME type associated with the  file  (e.g.   application/post-
            script).


       CUPS_CACHEDIR
            The directory for semi-persistent cache files can be found.


       CUPS_DATADIR
            The directory where data files can be found.


       CUPS_FILETYPE
            The  type of file being printed: "job-sheet" for a banner page and
            "document" for a regular print file.


       CUPS_SERVERROOT
            The root directory of the server.


       DEVICE_URI
            The device-uri associated with the printer.


       FINAL_CONTENT_TYPE
            The  MIME  type  associated  with  the  printer  (e.g.    applica-
            tion/vnd.cups-postscript).


       LANG
            The default language locale (typically C or en).


       PATH

            for this printer.


       PRINTER
            The name of the printer.


       RIP_CACHE
            The  recommended  amount of memory to use for Raster Image Proces-

       USER
            The user executing the filter, typically "lp" or  "root";  consult
            the cupsd.conf(5) file for the current setting.


COMPATIBILITY
       While  the  filter  interface  is  compatible  with  System V interface
       scripts, it will only work with the System V interface  script  as  the
       only  filter.   Typically the interface script will be provided via the
       lpadmin(8) command using the -i option.
