KDESTROY(1)                                                        KDESTROY(1)



NAME
       kdestroy - destroy Kerberos tickets

SYNOPSIS
       kdestroy [-q] [-a | -A | -c cache_name | -p principal_name]

DESCRIPTION
       The kdestroy utility destroys the user's active Kerberos authentication
       tickets by writing zeros to the specified credentials cache  that  con-
       tains  them.   If  the  credentials cache is not specified, the default
       credentials cache is destroyed.  kdestroy will destroy both Kerberos  4
       and Kerberos 5 tickets if they are present.

OPTIONS
       -q     Run  quietly.   Normally kdestroy prints an error if it fails to
              destroy the user's tickets.  The -q flag suppresses this  behav-
              ior.

       -a     Destroy all credentials caches (same as -A).  This option cannot
              be combined with -c or -p.

       -A     Destroy all credentials caches (same as -a).  This option cannot
              be combined with -c or -p.

       -c cache_name
              Use  cache_name as the credentials (ticket) cache name and loca-
              tion. This option cannot be combined with -a, -A or -p.

              The default credentials cache may vary between systems.

       -p principal_name
              Destroy all credentials caches which contain tickets for princi-
              pal_name.  principal_name  should be in the Kerberos 5 principal
              format.  This option cannot be combined with -a, -A or -c.

       Most Kerberos installations recommend that you place  the  kdestroy  -A
       command  in your .logout file, so that your tickets are destroyed auto-
       matically when you log out.
