XCODE_SELECT(1)           BSD General Commands Manual          XCODE_SELECT(1)

NAME
     xcode-select -- Manages the path to the Xcode folder for Xcode BSD tools.

SYNOPSIS
     xcode-select [-help]
     xcode-select [-switch xcode_folder_path]
     xcode-select [-print-path]
     xcode-select [-version]

DESCRIPTION
     xcode-select controls the location of the Xcode folder which will be used
     by xcodebuild(1) and other, related Xcode BSD tools. This allows you to
     easily switch between using different versions of the Xcode tools, and
     can be used to update the path to the current Xcode folder if it is moved
     after installation.

     xcode-select does not affect gcc(1), ld(1), gdb(1), and many of the other
     Xcode BSD tools. For a list of the tools which do use xcode-select, see
     FILES below.

   Usage
     When multiple Xcode folders are installed on a system (e.g. "/Xcode2.5",
     containing Xcode 2.5, and "/Developer", containing Xcode 3.0), use
     xcode-select -switch xcode_folder_path to specify the Xcode folder that
     you wish to use.

     After setting an Xcode folder, running /usr/bin/xcodebuild will automati-
     cally invoke the version of xcodebuild(1) out of the current Xcode
     folder. Your own scripts, makefiles, and other tools can use xcode-select
     -print-path to find this path, making it easy to switch them between dif-
     ferent versions of the Xcode tools and allowing them to function properly
     on systems where the Xcode folder has been installed to a non-default
     location.

     xcode-select does not guarantee a valid path to an Xcode folder. If the
     current Xcode folder is moved, xcode-select -switch new_xcode_folder_path
     should be run to update to its new location.

   Options
     -help
           Prints the usage message.

     -switch xcode_folder_path
           Sets the path to the current Xcode folder, e.g. "/Developer". This
           command must be run with superuser permissions, and will affect all
           users on the system. To set the path without superuser permissions
           or only for the current shell session, use the DEVELOPER_DIR envi-
           ronment variable instead.

     -print-path
           Prints the path of the current Xcode folder. This is a recommended
           way for scripts and other tools to locate the current Xcode folder.

     -version
           Prints xcode-select version information.

ENVIRONMENT
     DEVELOPER_DIR  Overrides the Xcode folder path. When DEVELOPER_DIR is
                    set, its value will be used instead of the value last
                    passed to -switch xcode_folder_path

EXAMPLES
     xcode-select -switch /Developer

             Sets xcodebuild(1), ibtool(1), and other tools which use the
             xcode-select path to find these tools in "/Developer" (e.g.
             "/Developer/usr/bin/xcodebuild").

     `xcode-select -print-path`/usr/bin/gcc

             Runs gcc out of the current Xcode folder.

     export DEVELOPER_DIR="/Xcode2.5"; /usr/bin/xcodebuild

             Runs /Xcode2.5/usr/bin/xcodebuild.

FILES
     /usr/bin/agvtool     Runs agvtool(1) from the current Xcode folder.
     /usr/bin/ibtool      Runs ibtool(1) from the current Xcode folder.
     /usr/bin/opendiff    Runs opendiff(1) from the current Xcode folder.
     /usr/bin/xcodebuild  Runs xcodebuild(1) from the current Xcode folder.
     /usr/bin/xcodeindex  Runs xcodeindex(1) from the current Xcode folder.
     /usr/bin/instruments
                          Runs instruments(1) from the current Xcode folder.

SEE ALSO
     agvtool(1), ibtool(1), opendiff(1), xcodebuild(1), xcodeindex(1),
     instruments(1)

HISTORY
     The xcode-select command first appeared in Xcode 3.0.
