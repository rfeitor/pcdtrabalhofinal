CHUDREMOTECTRL(1)                                            CHUDREMOTECTRL(1)



NAME
       chudRemoteCtrl  -  start  or stop the collection of performance monitor
       data in a performance monitor remote server application.

SYNOPSIS
       chudRemoteCtrl [ -m ] [ executable [args... ] ]

       chudRemoteCtrl -s label

       chudRemoteCtrl -e

       chudRemoteCtrl -k PID


DESCRIPTION
       chudRemoteCtrl is a command line tool that allows for the collection of
       performance data by any active performance monitor remote server appli-
       cation. There are currently two CHUD Tools that can be put in remote
       performance monitor server mode: MONster, and Shark (as well as their
       command line counterparts). Typically, chudRemoteCtrl is invoked on the
       command line or in a shell script, followed by the path to an exe-
       cutable to be measured and its arguments.  chudRemoteCtrl issues a
       chudStartRemotePerfMonitor message immediately after launching the
       specified target program. When the launched program terminates, chu-
       dRemoteCtrl issues a chudStopRemotePerfMonitor message, and then exits.
       When the '-s', '-e' or '-k PID' options are used, no program is
       launched.


OPTIONS
       -r     seconds: If the 'chudStartRemotePerfMonitor' message fails to
              either acquire or start the remote monitoring service, then keep
              trying to start again, until the specified number of seconds has
              elapsed.  The same thing is true of the '-e' option. If there is
              a '-r <seconds>' argument on the command line, and a failure
              occurs trying to stop the remote profiling program, the stop
              message will be sent again until the retry time limit is
              reached.

       -s     label: Issue a chudStartRemotePerfMonitor message with the spec-
              ified label and exit. A 'label' is a string of up to 32 charac-
              ters.

       -e     Issue a chudStopRemotePerfMonitor message and exit.

       -q     silence some of the non-essential warning and error output.

       -kPID  Send a UNIX signal (SIGUSR1 to start profiling, SIGUSR2 to stop
              profiling) to the specified process-id. For example, if a com-
              mand-line profiling tool, is running as PID 4267, using '-k
              4267' along with a '-s' will send a SIGUSR1 to the command-line
              profiling tool and it will start sampling, while '-k 4267' along
              with a '-e' will send a SIGUSR2 to the command-line profiling
              tool and it will stop sampling. A 'start' example: % chudRemo-
              teCtrl -s session_42 -k 4267.  And a 'stop' example: % chudRemo-
              teCtrl -e -k 4267.  The command-line CHUD tool 'shark' responds
              to UNIX signals and toggles performance profiling.  You can
              repeatedly send '-s <label> -k <PID#>' to shark and it will tog-
              gle profiling start or stop.  Sending '-e -k <PID#>' to shark
              will stop sampling (if it's running) and cause shark to EXIT.

       -m     Set the performance monitor mark bit in the main thread of the
              launched child process.


DIAGNOSTICS
       chudRemoteCtrl returns a zero (0) upon success and a non-zero value on
       failure.
