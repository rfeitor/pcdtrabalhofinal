DESCRIPTION
     xcodebuild builds a target contained in an Xcode project.

   Usage
     Run xcodebuild from the directory containing your project (i.e. the
     directory containing the projectname.xcodeproj package). If you have
     multiple projects in the this directory you will need to use -project to
     indicate which project should be built.

     By default, xcodebuild builds the first target listed in your project,
     with the default build configuration. The order of the targets is a prop-
     erty of the project and is the same for all users of the project. The
     active target and active build configuration properties are set for each
     user of the project and can vary from user to user.

   Options
     -project projectname
           Build the project specified by projectname.  Required if there are
           multiple project files in the same directory.

     -activetarget
           Builds the user's active target.

     -alltargets
           Build all the targets in the project.

     -target targetname
           Build the target specified by targetname.

     -nodependencies
           Only perform the action on the specified target(s), not on any tar-
           gets upon which they depend.  This option only applies to the
           'clean' action.

     -parallelizeTargets
           Build independent targets in parallel when possible.  With distrib-
           uted builds or multiprocessor machines, this can cause projects
           with many simple targets to build substantially faster.  This
           option only applies to targets with target dependencies.

     -activeconfiguration
           Use the user's active build configuration when building the target.

     -configuration configurationname
           Use the build configuration specified by configurationname when
           building the target.

     -sdk <sdkfullpath> | <sdkname>
           Build an Xcode project against the specified SDK, using build tools
           appropriate for that SDK. The argument may be an absolute path to
           an SDK, or the canonical name of an SDK.

     -showsdks
           Lists all available SDKs, including their canonical names suitable
           for use with -sdk.

     buildaction ...
           Specify a build action (or actions) to perform on the target.
           Available build actions are:

           build       Build the target in the build root (SYMROOT).  This is
                       the default build action.

           installsrc  Copy the source of the project to the source root
                       (SRCROOT).

           install     Build the target and install it into the target's
                       installation directory in the distribution root
                       (DSTROOT).

           clean       Remove build products and intermediate files from the
                       build root (SYMROOT).

     setting=value
           Set the build setting setting to value.

     -find binary -sdk <sdkfullpath> | <sdkname>
           Print the absolute path to binary in the context of sdk.  If the
           -sdk argument is not provided, find uses the value of the build
           setting SDKROOT, if set. Returns EINVAL if a valid SDK could not be
           determined.  The search order is the usr/bin directory in the SDK,
           the bin directory in the SDK, then each of the paths specified by
           the PATH environment variable.  Returns ENOENT if the requested
           binary could not be located in any of the searched directories.

           NOTE: 'xcrun -find' is preferred because it caches the resulting
           find; xcrun uses xcodebuild to populate its cache.

     -version
           Display version information.  When used in conjunction with -sdk,
           the version of the specified SDK is displayed, or all SDKs if -sdk
           is given no value.  Additionally, a single line of the reported
           version information may be returned if specified.

     -default=value
           Set the user default default to value.

     -list
           Lists the targets in the project. Does not initiate a build.

     -nodistribute
           Disable distributed building. Overrides the distributed build set-
           ting stored in the user defaults by the Xcode preferences panel.

     -bonjourbuildhosts
           Enable distributed building and search for build machines using
           Bonjour. Build machines are added dynamically during the build as
           they are discovered. May be used alone or in conjunction with
           -buildhosts or -buildhostsfile.

     -nobonjourbuildhosts
           Do not search for build machines using Bonjour. Overrides the Bon-
           jour distributed build setting stored in the user defaults by the
           Xcode preferences panel.

     -buildhosts hostlist
           Enable distributed building and set the list of build machines to
           the space separated list given in hostlist.

     -buildhostsfile hostsfile
           Enable distributed building and set the list of build machines to
           the contents of hostsfile.  hostsfile is a text file containing
           build machine names, one per line.

     -help
           Displays usage information for xcodebuild.

EXAMPLES
     xcodebuild clean install

             Cleans the build directory; then builds and installs the first
             target in the project.

     xcodebuild -target MyTarget OBJROOT=/Build/MyProj/Obj.root
             SYMROOT=/Build/MyProj/Sym.root

             Builds the target MyTarget putting object (intermediate) files in
             one directory and the products of the build in another directory.

     xcodebuild -sdk macosx10.4

             Builds an Xcode project against the Mac OS X 10.4 SDK.  The
             canonical names of all available SDKs can be viewed using the
             -showsdks option.
