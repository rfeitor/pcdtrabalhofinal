weblatency.d(1m)                 USER COMMANDS                weblatency.d(1m)



NAME
       weblatency.d - website latency statistics. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       weblatency.d

DESCRIPTION
       This prints statistics for hostnames that browers have set GET requests
       for, in particular latency by hostname.

       The latency measured is from the browser sending  the  GET  request  to
       when  the  browser  begins  to  recieve  the response. It is an overall
       response time for the client, and encompasses connection speed  delays,
       DNS lookups, proxy delays, and web server response time.

       This  is  written as an experimental tool, and may not work at all with
       your browser.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Print report after Ctrl-C is hit,
              # weblatency.d


FIELDS
       HOST   hostname from URL

       NUM    number of GETs

       AVGTIME(ms)
              Average time for response, ms

       MAXTIME(ms)
              Maximum time for response, ms


NOTES
       See  the source code for the "BROWSER" variable, which sets the browser
       to trace (currently set to "mozilla-bin").


IDEA
       Bryan Cantrill (who wrote an elegant version for Sol 10 update 1)


DOCUMENTATION
       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the  Docs  direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       weblatency.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
