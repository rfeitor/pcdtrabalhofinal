NAME
       README.macos - Perl under Mac OS (Classic)

SYNOPSIS
       This document briefly describes perl under Mac OS (Classic).  If you
       are running perl under Mac OS X, you don't want to be here (unless you
       are in the Classic environment under Mac OS X).

       When we say "Mac OS" below, we mean Mac OS 7, 8, and 9, and not Mac OS
       X.

DESCRIPTION
       The latest perl source itself builds on Mac OS, with some additional
       pieces. Support for Mac OS is now in the perl core, and MacPerl is kept
       in close sync with regular perl releases.

       To build perl for Mac OS (as an MPW tool), you will need the addition
       of the macos subdirectory, distributed separately.  It includes extra
       source files, config files, and make files.  It also includes extra
       Mac-specific modules.

       To build the MacPerl application, you will also need the macperl
       directory, which includes the source files for creating the application
       itself.

       All of this is available from the development site, via HTTP (in the
       MacPerl Installer, which includes all the source and binaries) and
       anonymous CVS.

               http://dev.macperl.org/

       The source is also in the main perl repository in the macperl branch
       (the 5.6 source is in the maint-5.6/macperl branch).

       You will also need compilers and libraries, all of them freely
       available.  These are linked to from the SourceForge site. Go that site
       for all things having to do with MacPerl development.

       MacPerl 5.6.1 and later are supported on Mac OS 8.1 and later, for
       68040 and PowerPC architectures.  The MPW tool may be used on Mac OS
       7.5.5 and 68030 computers.

       MacPerl 5.2.0r4 is also available, on the CPAN and on SourceForge.  It
       is based on perl 5.004, and works with Mac OS 7.5.5 and 68030
       computers.
