PERL(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  PERL(1)

NAME
     perl, a2p -- Practical Extraction and Report Language

SYNOPSIS
     perl ...
     a2p ...

DESCRIPTION
     To support multiple versions, the program named perl now just selects the
     real version of Perl to run, and the program named a2p now just selects
     the real version of the awk-to-perl translator to run, depending on vari-
     ous settings.  The current supported versions are 5.8.8 (provided for
     backward-compatibility with the Perl 5.8 family) and 5.10.0, with the
     default being 5.10.0.  Use

           % man perl5.8.8
           % man perl5.10.0
           % man a2p5.8.8
           % man a2p5.10.0

     to see the man page for a specific version.  Without a version specified,

           % man perldoc

     and the like, will show the man page for the (unmodified) default version
     of Perl (5.10.0).  To see the man page for a specific version, use, for
     example,

           % man perldoc5.8.8

CHANGING THE DEFAULT PERL
     Using

           % defaults write com.apple.versioner.perl Version 5.8.8

     will make version 5.8.8 the user default when running the both the perl
     and a2p commands (versioner is the internal name of the version-selection
     software used).

     To set a system-wide default, replace `com.apple.versioner.perl' with
     `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.versioner.perl' (admin privileges will be
     required).

     The environment variable VERSIONER_PERL_VERSION can also be used to set
     the perl and a2p version:

           % export VERSIONER_PERL_VERSION=5.8.8 # Bourne-like shells
                or
           % setenv VERSIONER_PERL_VERSION 5.8.8 # C-like shells
           % perl ...

     This environment variable takes precedence over the preference file set-
     tings.

64-BIT SUPPORT
     Version 5.10.0 supports 64-bit execution (which is on by default).  Ver-
     sion 5.8.8 only supports 32-bit execution.

     Like the version of Perl, the perl command can select between 32 and
     64-bit execution (when both are available).  Use:

           % defaults write com.apple.versioner.perl Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes

     to make 32-bit execution the user default (using
     `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.versioner.perl' will set the system-wide
     default).  The environment variable VERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT can also
     be used (has precedence over the preference file):

           % export VERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT=yes # Bourne-like shells
                or
           % setenv VERSIONER_PERL_PREFER_32_BIT yes # C-like shells

     Again, the preference setting and environmental variable applies to both
     perl and a2p.

USING A SPECIFIC VERSION
     Rather than using the perl command, one can use a specific version
     directly.  For example, running perl5.8.8 from the command line will run
     the 5.8.8 version of Perl, independent of what the default version of
     Perl is.

     One can use a specific version of Perl on the #! line of a script, but
     that may have portability and future compatibility issues.

     Note that the preference files and environment variable that apply to the
     perl command, do not apply when running a specific version of Perl.  In
     particular, running perl5.10.0 will always default to 64-bit execution
     (unless one uses the arch(1) command to specifically select a 32-bit
     architecture).
