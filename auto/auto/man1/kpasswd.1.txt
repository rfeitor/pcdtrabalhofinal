NAME
       kpasswd - change a user's Kerberos password

SYNOPSIS
       kpasswd [principal]

DESCRIPTION
       The  kpasswd command is used to change a Kerberos principal's password.
       kpasswd prompts for the current Kerberos password,  which  is  used  to
       obtain  a  changepw  ticket from the KDC for the user's Kerberos realm.
       If kpasswd successfully  obtains  the  changepw  ticket,  the  user  is
       prompted twice for the new password, and the password is changed.

       If  the  principal  is  governed  by a policy that specifies the length
       and/or number of character classes required in the  new  password,  the
       new  password  must conform to the policy.  (The five character classes
       are lower case, upper case, numbers, punctuation, and all other charac-
       ters.)

OPTIONS
       principal
              change  the password for the Kerberos principal principal.  Oth-
              erwise, kpasswd uses the principal name from the system  default
              ccache  if  there  is one; if not, the principal is derived from
              the identity of the user invoking the kpasswd command.

PORTS
       kpasswd looks first for kpasswd_server = host:port in the [realms] sec-
       tion  of the edu.mit.Kerberos file under the current realm.  If that is
       missing, kpasswd looks for the admin_server entry, but substitutes  464
       for the port.
