md(1)                     BSD General Commands Manual                    md(1)

NAME
     md -- process raw dependency files produced by cpp -MD

SYNOPSIS
     md [-d] [-f] [-m makefile] [-u makefile] [-o outputfile] [-v] [-x]
        [-D c|d|m|o|t|D]

DESCRIPTION
     The md command basically does two things:

     Process the raw dependency files produced by the cpp -MD option.  There
     is one line in the file for every #include encountered, but there are
     repeats and patterns like .../dir1/../dir2 that appear which should
     reduce to .../dir2.  md canonicalizes and flushes repeats from the depen-
     dency list.  It also sorts the file names and "fills" them to a 78 char-
     acter line.

     md also updates the makefile directly with the dependency information, so
     the .d file can be thrown away (see d option).  This is done to save
     space.  md assumes that dependency information in the makefile is sorted
     by .o file name and it procedes to merge in (add/or replace [as appropri-
     ate]) the new dependency lines that it has generated.  For time effi-
     ciency, md assumes that any .d files it is given that were created before
     the creation date of the "makefile" were processed already.  It ignores
     them unless the force flag [f] is given.

FLAG SUMMARY
     -D c|D|d|m|o|t
             Specify debugging option(s):

             c       show file contents

             D       show very low level debugging

             d       show new dependency crunching

             m       show generation of makefile

             o       show files being opened

             t       show time comparisons

     -d      Delete the .d file after it is processed

     -f      Force an update of the dependencies in the makefile, even if the
             makefile is more recent than the .n file.  (This implies that md
             has been run already.)

     -m makefile
             Specify the makefile to be upgraded.  The defaults are makefile
             and then Makefile.

     -o outputfile
             Specify an output file (other than a makefile) for the dependen-
             cies.

     -u makefile
             Like -m, but the file will be created if necessary.

     -v      Set the verbose flag.

     -x      Expunge old dependency information from the makefile.
