NAME
     rails -- Web-application framework

SYNOPSIS
     rails path [options...]

DESCRIPTION
     Rails is a web-application and persistence framework that includes every-
     thing needed to create database-backed web-applications according to the
     Model-View-Control pattern of separation. This pattern splits the view
     (also called the presentation) into "dumb" templates that are primarily
     responsible for inserting pre-built data in between HTML tags. The model
     contains the "smart" domain objects (such as Account, Product, Person,
     Post) that holds all the business logic and knows how to persist them-
     selves to a database. The controller handles the incoming requests (such
     as Save New Account, Update Product, Show Post) by manipulating the model
     and directing data to the view.

     Rails is written with the ruby(1) language. For more information about
     Rails you can use its ---help flag. There is also online documentation
     available at "http://rubyonrails.org".
