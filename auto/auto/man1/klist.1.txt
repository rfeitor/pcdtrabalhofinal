KLIST(1)                                                              KLIST(1)



NAME
       klist - list cached Kerberos tickets

SYNOPSIS
       klist  [-5]  [-4]  [-e] [[-c] [-A] [-f] [-s] [-a  [-n]]] [-k [-t] [-K]]
       [cache_name | keytab_name]

DESCRIPTION
       Klist lists the Kerberos principal and Kerberos tickets held in a  cre-
       dentials cache, or the keys held in a keytab file.

OPTIONS
       -5     list Kerberos 5 credentials.  This option will not list Kerberos
              4 credentials unless -4 is also specified.

       -4     list Kerberos 4 credentials.  This option will not list Kerberos
              5 credentials unless -5 is also specified.

       -e     displays  the encryption types of the session key and the ticket
              for each credential in the credential cache, or each key in  the
              keytab file.

       -c     List  tickets  held in a credentials cache.  This is the default
              if neither -c nor -k is specified.

       -A     lists all caches in the credentials cache.

       -f     shows the flags present in the credentials, using the  following
              abbreviations:

                   F    Forwardable
                   f    forwarded
                   P    Proxiable
                   p    proxy
                   D    postDateable
                   d    postdated
                   R    Renewable
                   I    Initial
                   i    invalid
                   H    Hardware authenticated
                   A    preAuthenticated
                   O    OK as delegate
                   a    anonymous


       -s     causes  klist  to run silently (produce no output), but to still
              set the exit status according to whether it  finds  the  creden-
              tials  cache.   The  exit status is '0' if klist finds a creden-
              tials cache, with a valid ticket granting ticket and '1'  if  it
              does not.

       -a     display list of addresses in credentials.

       -n     show numeric addresses instead of reverse-resolving addresses.

       -k     List keys held in a keytab file.

       -t     display  the  time entry timestamps for each keytab entry in the
              keytab file.

       -K     display the value of the encryption key in each keytab entry  in
              the keytab file.

       If  cache_name  or keytab_name is not specified, klist will display the
       credentials in the system default credentials cache or keytab  file  as
       appropriate.

FILES
       /etc/krb5.keytab
              default location for the local host's keytab file.
