LESSECHO(1)                                                        LESSECHO(1)



NAME
       lessecho - expand metacharacters, such as * and ?, in filenames on Unix
       systems.

SYNOPSIS
       lessecho [-ox] [-cx] [-pn] [-dn] [-a] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents briefly the lessecho command.   This  manual
       page  was  written  for  the  Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the
       original program does not have a manual page.

       lessecho is a program that simply echos its filename arguments on stan-
       dard  output. But any argument containing spaces is enclosed in quotes.

OPTIONS
       A summary of options are included below.

       -ox    Specifies "x" to be the open quote character.

       -cx    Specifies "x" to be the close quote character.

       -pn    Specifies "n" to be the open quote character, as an integer.

       -dn    Specifies "n" to be the close quote character, as an integer.

       -a     Specifies that all arguments are to be quoted.  The  default  is
              that only arguments containing spaces are quoted.
