NAME
     rake -- Ruby Make

SYNOPSIS
     rake [-f rakefile] [options...] targets...

DESCRIPTION
     Rake is a simple ruby(1) build program with capabilities similar to the
     regular make(1) command.

     Rake has the following features:

     +   Rakefiles (Rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
         standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile syntax
         to worry about (is that a tab or a space?).

     +   Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.

     +   Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit tasks.

     +   Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating
         file names and paths.

     For more information about Rake you can use its ---help flag. There is
     also online documentation available at "http://docs.rubyrake.org".
