NAME
       jvisualvm  - Java Virtual Machine Monitoring, Troubleshooting, and Pro-
       filing Tool


SYNOPSIS
               jvisualvm [ options ]



PARAMETERS
       Options, if used, should follow immediately  after  the  command  name.
       Options  may be in any order. For a discussion of parameters that apply
       to a specific option, see OPTIONS below.


DESCRIPTION
       Java VisualVM is an intuitive graphical user  interface  that  provides
       detailed  information  about  Java  technology-based applications (Java
       applications) while they are running on a given  Java  Virtual  Machine
       (JVM(*)). The name Java VisualVM comes from the fact that Java VisualVM
       provides information about the JVM software visually.


       Java VisualVM combines several monitoring, troubleshooting, and profil-
       ing  utilities into a single tool. For example, most of the functional-
       ity offered by the standalone tools jmap, jinfo, jstat and jstack  have
       been integrated into Java VisualVM. Other functionalities, such as some
       of those offered by  the  JConsole  tool,  can  be  added  as  optional
       plug-ins.


OPTIONS
       The following option is possible when you launch Java VisualVM.




             -J<jvm_option>
                Pass this <jvm_option> to the JVM software.



USAGE
       Java  VisualVM is useful to Java application developers to troubleshoot
       applications and to monitor and improve the applications'  performance.
       Java  VisualVM can allow developers to generate and analyse heap dumps,
       track down memory leaks, perform and monitor  garbage  collection,  and
       perform  lightweight memory and CPU profiling. Plug-ins also exist that
       expand the functionality of Java VisualVM. For  example,  most  of  the
       functionality  of the JConsole tool is available via the MBeans Tab and
       JConsole Plug-in Wrapper plug-ins. You can choose  from  a  catalog  of
       standard Java VisualVM plug-ins by selecting 'Tools' | 'Plugins' in the
       Java VisualVM menus.


       Start Java VisualVM with the following command:

       %  jvisualvm <options>
