iodbc-config(1)              iODBC Driver Manager              iodbc-config(1)



NAME
       iodbc-config - script to get information about the installed version of
       iODBC


SYNOPSIS
       iodbc-config   [--prefix[=DIR]]    [--exec-prefix[=DIR]]    [--version]
       [--cflags]   [--libs]   [--static-libs]   [--libtool-libs]  [--odbcini]
       [--odbcinstini]


DESCRIPTION
       iodbc-config is a tool that is used to configure to determine the  com-
       piler and linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs
       that use iODBC.

OPTIONS
       iodbc-config accepts the following options:

       --version
               Print the currently installed version of iODBC on the  standard
               output.

       --cflags
               Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile an iODBC
               program.

       --libs  Print the linker flags that are necessary to link an iODBC pro-
               gram using dynamic libraries (if supported).

       --static-libs
               Print the linker flags that are necessary to link an iODBC pro-
               gram using static libraries.

       --libtool-libs
               Print the linker flags that are necessary to link an iODBC pro-
               gram in a libtool environment.

       --odbcini
               Print the path of the system wide odbc.ini file.

       --odbcinstini
               Print the path of the system wide odbcinst.ini file.

       --prefix[=PREFIX]
               If  specified,  use  PREFIX  instead of the installation prefix
               that iODBC was built with when computing  the  output  for  the
               --cflags  and  --libs options. This option is also used for the
               exec prefix if --exec-prefix was  not  specified.  This  option
               must be specified before any --libs or --cflags options.

               If PREFIX is not specified, the --prefix flag shows where iODBC
               is currently installed.

       --exec-prefix=PREFIX
               If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec  pre-
               fix that iODBC was built with when computing the output for the
               --cflags and --libs options.  This  option  must  be  specified
               before any --libs or --cflags options.


EXAMPLES
       To compile a program that calls the iODBC API, make sure the iodbc-con-
       fig program can be found in the PATH environment variable, before using
       the following Makefile fragment:

           CFLAGS=`iodbc-config --cflags`
           LDLIBS=`iodbc-config --libs`

           iodbctest: iodbctest.c
                cc $(CFLAGS) -o iodbctest iodbctest.c $(LDLIBS)
