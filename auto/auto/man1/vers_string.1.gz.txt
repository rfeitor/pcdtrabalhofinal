VERS_STRING(1)                                                  VERS_STRING(1)



NAME
       vers_string - produce version identification string

SYNOPSIS
       vers_string [ -[c | f | l] ] PROGRAM

DESCRIPTION
       Vers_string  outputs a string made up of the SGS version name, the cur-
       rent  user's  login  identifier,  and  the  current  time   and   date.
       Vers_string may only be used within an SGS project.

       The  output  of  vers_string  has  the  following  format: PROGRAM:prog
       PROJECT:proj&vers  DEVELOPER:bob  BUILT:Thu Dec 31  ...   prog  is  the
       command line argument PROGRAM, proj&vers is the name of the SGS version
       root, and bob is the user who built this version.

       If the -c option is used, the output is formed as a C  declaration  for
       the  global  character  array  SGS_VERS.  If the -l option is used, the
       output is formed like the -c option, but  "PROGRAM"  is  replaced  with
       "LIBRARY" and the declaration is static.  If the -f option is used, the
       output is simply the program name and suffixed with the current version
       number of the SGS version root.

       Vers_string  is  typically  used  within  makefiles  with  a rule like:
       vers.c: ${OBJS}      vers_string -c ${PROGRAM} >vers.c
