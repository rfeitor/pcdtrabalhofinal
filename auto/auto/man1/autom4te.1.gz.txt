NAME
       autom4te - Generate files and scripts thanks to M4

SYNOPSIS
       autom4te [OPTION] ... [FILES]

DESCRIPTION
       Run  GNU  M4 on the FILES, avoiding useless runs.  Output the traces if
       tracing, the frozen file if freezing, otherwise the  expansion  of  the
       FILES.

       If  some of the FILES are named `FILE.m4f' they are considered to be M4
       frozen files of  all  the  previous  files  (which  are  therefore  not
       loaded).   If  `FILE.m4f'  is  not  found, then `FILE.m4' will be used,
       together with all the previous files.

       Some files may be optional, i.e., will only be processed  if  found  in
       the  include  path,  but then must end in `.m4?';  the question mark is
       not part of the actual file name.
