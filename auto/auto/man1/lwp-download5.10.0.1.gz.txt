NAME
       lwp-download - Fetch large files from the web

SYNOPSIS
       lwp-download [-a] <url> [<local path>]

DESCRIPTION
       The lwp-download program will save the file at url to a local file.

       If local path is not specified, then the current directory is assumed.

       If local path is a directory, then the basename of the file to save is
       picked up from the Content-Disposition header or the URL of the
       response.  If the file already exists, then lwp-download will prompt
       before it overwrites and will fail if its standard input is not a
       terminal.  This form of invocation will also fail is no acceptable
       filename can be derived from the sources mentioned above.

       If local path is not a directory, then it is simply used as the path to
       save into.

       The lwp-download program is implemented using the libwww-perl library.
       It is better suited to down load big files than the lwp-request program
       because it does not store the file in memory.  Another benefit is that
       it will keep you updated about its progress and that you don't have
       much options to worry about.

       Use the "-a" option to save the file in text (ascii) mode.  Might make
       a difference on dosish systems.

EXAMPLE
       Fetch the newest and greatest perl version:

        $ lwp-download http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz
        Saving to 'latest.tar.gz'...
