FIXUPRESOURCEFORKS(1)     BSD General Commands Manual    FIXUPRESOURCEFORKS(1)

NAME
     /System/Library/CoreServices/FixupResourceForks -- Join AppleDouble files
     into two-fork HFS resource files.

SYNOPSIS
     /System/Library/CoreServices/FixupResourceForks [-q[uiet]] [-nosetinfo]
                                                     [-nodelete] path ...

DESCRIPTION
     FixupResourceForks is to SplitForks what matter is to antimatter.  Given
     one or more directories that reside on an HFS or Extended HFS ("HFS+")
     volume, it scans those directories for AppleDouble files and, if found,
     rejoins them into two-fork resource files.  The resource fork data can
     then be accessed with normal Carbon Resource Manager calls, be processed
     with DeRez(1), and accessed from the POSIX file system interface through
     the ..namedfork/rsrc path mechanism.

     /System/Library/CoreServices/FixupResourceForks takes the following flags
     and arguments:

     -q[uiet]
              Suppress verbose diagnostics to standard output.

     -nosetinfo
              Do not set file system metadata (type, creator, flags, permis-
              sions) from the data in the AppleDouble file.

     -nodelete
              Leave the AppleDouble files in the directory after copying their
              resource data into the resource fork of the main file.

     path ...
              One or more directory paths.  Note that FixupResourceForks only
              acts on entire directories, not in individual files.

FILES
     foo     Data fork of file 'foo'

NOTES
     SplitForks will fail with error 2 if the designated file is not on an HFS
     or Extended HFS file system volume.
