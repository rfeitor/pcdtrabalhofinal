SNMPGETNEXT(1)                     Net-SNMP                     SNMPGETNEXT(1)



NAME
       snmpgetnext  -  communicates  with  a network entity using SNMP GETNEXT
       requests

SYNOPSIS
       snmpgetnext [COMMON OPTIONS] [-Cf] OID [OID]...

DESCRIPTION
       snmpget is an SNMP application that uses the SNMP  GETNEXT  request  to
       query  for information on a network entity.  One or more object identi-
       fiers (OIDs) may be given as arguments on the command line.  Each vari-
       able  name  is given in the format specified in variables(5).  For each
       one, the variable  that  is  lexicographically  "next"  in  the  remote
       entity's MIB will be returned.

       For example:

       snmpgetnext -c public zeus interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.1

       will retrieve the variable interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2:

       interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifType.2 = softwareLoopback(24)

       If  the  network  entity has an error processing the request packet, an
       error message will be shown,  helping  to  pinpoint  in  what  way  the
       request was malformed.

OPTIONS
       snmpgetnext takes the common options described in the snmpcmd(1) manual
       page and also the -Cf option described in the snmpget(1) manual page.
