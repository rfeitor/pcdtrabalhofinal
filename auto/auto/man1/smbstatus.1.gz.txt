NAME
       smbstatus - report on current Samba connections

SYNOPSIS
       smbstatus  [-P]  [-b]  [-d <debug level>]  [-v]  [-L]  [-B]  [-p]  [-S]
        [-s <configuration file>] [-u <username>]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       smbstatus is a very simple program to list the  current  Samba  connec-
       tions.

OPTIONS
       -P|--profile
          If samba has been compiled with the profiling option, print only the
          contents of the profiling shared memory area.

       -b|--brief
          gives brief output.

       -V
          Prints the program version number.

       -s <configuration file>
          The file specified contains the configuration  details  required  by
          the  server.  The  information in this file includes server-specific
          information such as what printcap file to use, as well  as  descrip-
          tions  of  all  the  services  that  the  server  is to provide. See
          smb.conf for more information. The default configuration  file  name
          is determined at compile time.

       -d|--debuglevel=level
          level  is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this parame-
          ter is not specified is zero.

          The higher this value, the more detail will be  logged  to  the  log
          files  about the activities of the server. At level 0, only critical
          errors and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a  reasonable
          level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of infor-
          mation about operations carried out.

          Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log  data,  and
          should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are
          designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
          data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

          Note that specifying this parameter here will override the

          parameter in the smb.conf file.

       -l|--logfile=logdirectory
          Base  directory  name for log/debug files. The extension ".progname"
          will be appended (e.g. log.smbclient,  log.smbd,  etc...).  The  log
          file is never removed by the client.

       -v|--verbose
          gives verbose output.

       -L|--locks
          causes smbstatus to only list locks.

       -B|--byterange
          causes smbstatus to include byte range locks.

       -p|--processes
          print a list of smbd(8) processes and exit. Useful for scripting.

       -S|--shares
          causes smbstatus to only list shares.

       -h|--help
          Print a summary of command line options.

       -u|--user=<username>
          selects information relevant to username only.

AUTHOR
       The  original  Samba  software  and  related  utilities were created by
       Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed by the Samba Team  as  an  Open
       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.

       The  original  Samba  man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page
       sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of  Open
       Source  software,  available  at  ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/)  and
       updated for the Samba 2.0 release by Jeremy Allison. The conversion  to
       DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter. The conversion to Doc-
       Book XML 4.2 for Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy.
