NAME
       runocc.d - run queue occupancy by CPU. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       runocc.d

DESCRIPTION
       This  prints  the dispatcher run queue occupancy by CPU each second.  A
       consistant run queue occupancy is a sign of CPU saturation.

       The value is similar to that seen in "sar -q", however this  is  calcu-
       lated in a more accurate manner - sampling at 1000 Hertz.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Print %runocc by CPU every second,
              # runocc.d


FIELDS
       CPU    cpu ID

       %runocc
              percent run queue occupancy, sampled at 1000 Hertz

DOCUMENTATION
       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the  Docs  direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       runocc.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
