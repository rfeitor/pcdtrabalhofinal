SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       Like make, ant is a tool that can compile Java projects. But unlike it,
       ant is based on Java which means that it will  run  on  every  platform
       that  has a Java Virtual Machine. This makes it a great tool for build-
       ing Java software.

       By default it takes information from build.xml which describes the tar-
       gets.
