xcrun
     xcrun -- run or locate development tools

SYNOPSIS
     xcrun [-sdk SDK] -find <tool_name>

     xcrun [-sdk SDK] [-log] <tool_name> [<tool_arguments>]

     <tool_name> [<tool_arguments>]

DESCRIPTION
     xcrun provides a means locate or invoke coexistence- and platform-aware
     developer tools from the command-line, without requiring users to modify
     makefiles or otherwise take laborious or inconvenient measures to adopt
     Xcode's multiple tool chains.

     xcode-select is used to specify which installation of Xcode is used, and
     may be overridden by the DEVELOPER_DIR environment variable.

     The SDK defaults to the current OS SDK, and can be specified by SDKROOT
     environment variable or the -sdk flag (which takes precedences over SDK-
     ROOT).

USAGE
     The first usage returns the full path to the found tool_name.

     The second usage executes tool_name with the given tool_arguments.

     The last syntax is when xcrun replaces any of the standard UNIX developer
     tools (typically in /usr/bin).  In this case, xcrun will use its tool
     name to locate the corresponding tool within evaluated DEVELOPER_DIR and
     SDK.

     If the tool is not named xcrun , tool_arguments are not parsed by xcrun.

OPTIONS
     -verbose
           display information about how the redirected path is constructed.

     -no-cache
           don't consult the cache when looking up values.  In effect, causes
           the cache to be refreshed.

     -sdk SDK
           specifies which SDK to use.  Overrides any SDKROOT set in the envi-
           ronment.

     -log  print the full command line that is invoked.

     -find
           print the full path to the tool.

ENVIRONMENT
     DEVELOPER_DIR - specifies the search path for locating the current
     developer tools (overrides xcode-select default).

     SDKROOT - specifies the SDK to use; overriden by the command line -sdk
     flag.

     xcrun_log - same as specifying -log

     xcrun_nocache - same as specifying -no-cache

     xcrun_verbose - same as specifying -verbose


DIAGNOSTICS
     When xcrun is invoked with the name xcrun , the flags -log and -verbose
     are useful debugging aids.  The flag -no-cache can be used to bypass
     cache lookup.

     When xcrun as taken the place of another tool, the arguments are those of
     the tool replaced, and the various xcrun flags can't be used.  In this
     case, use the specific environment variables instead.
