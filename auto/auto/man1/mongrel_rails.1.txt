SYNOPSIS
     mongrel_rails command [options...]
     gpgen path [options...]

DESCRIPTION
     Mongrel is a fast HTTP library and server for Ruby that is intended for
     hosting Ruby web applications of any kind using plain HTTP rather than
     FastCGI or SCGI. It is framework agnostic and already supports Ruby On
     Rails, Og+Nitro, and Camping frameworks.

     mongrel_rails allows you to control the Mongrel server.

     gpgen helps you to create Mongrel plugins.

     For more information about a specific program you can use its --h flag.
     There is also online documentation available at "http://mongrel.ruby-
     forge.org".
