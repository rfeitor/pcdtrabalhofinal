ACL_TO_TEXT(3)           BSD Library Functions Manual           ACL_TO_TEXT(3)

NAME
     acl_to_text -- convert an ACL to text

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     char *
     acl_to_text(acl_t acl, ssize_t *len_p);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_to_text() function translates the ACL pointed to by argument acl
     into a NULL terminated character string.  If the pointer len_p is not
     NULL, then the function shall return the length of the string (not
     including the NULL terminator) in the location pointed to by len_p.  The
     format of the text string returned by acl_to_text() for an ACL of type
     ACL_TYPE_EXTENDED differs from that specified by the POSIX.1e standard,
     and this function cannot translate between formats.

     This function allocates any memory necessary to contain the string and
     returns a pointer to the string.  The caller should free any releasable
     memory, when the new string is no longer required, by calling acl_free(3)
     with the (void*)char as an argument.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the function shall return a pointer to the
     long text form of an ACL.  Otherwise, a value of (char*)NULL shall be
     returned and errno shall be set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_to_text() function
     shall return a value of (acl_t)NULL and set errno to the corresponding
     value:

     [EINVAL]           Argument acl does not point to a valid ACL.

                        The ACL denoted by acl contains one or more improperly
                        formed ACL entries, or for some other reason cannot be
                        translated into a text form of an ACL.

     [ENOMEM]           The character string to be returned requires more mem-
                        ory than is allowed by the hardware or software-
                        imposed memory management constraints.
