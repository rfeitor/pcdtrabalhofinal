NAME
       Tcl_UpVar, Tcl_UpVar2 - link one variable to another

SYNOPSIS
       #include <tcl.h>

       int
       Tcl_UpVar(interp, frameName, sourceName, destName, flags)

       int
       Tcl_UpVar2(interp, frameName, name1, name2, destName, flags)

ARGUMENTS
       Tcl_Interp *interp (in)              Interpreter  containing variables;
                                            also used for error reporting.

       const char *frameName (in)           Identifies the  stack  frame  con-
                                            taining source variable.  May have
                                            any of the forms accepted  by  the
                                            upvar command, such as #0 or 1.

       const char *sourceName (in)          Name  of  source  variable, in the
                                            frame  given  by  frameName.   May
                                            refer  to  a scalar variable or to
                                            an array variable with a parenthe-
                                            sized index.

       const char *destName (in)            Name   of   destination  variable,
                                            which is to be  linked  to  source
                                            variable  so  that  references  to
                                            destName refer to the other  vari-
                                            able.   Must  not  currently exist
                                            except as an upvar-ed variable.

       int flags (in)                       One of TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY, TCL_NAMES-
                                            PACE_ONLY or 0;  if non-zero, then
                                            destName is a global or  namespace
                                            variable;   otherwise  it is local
                                            to the current procedure (or  cur-
                                            rent  namespace if no procedure is
                                            active).

       const char *name1 (in)               First part  of  source  variable's
                                            name  (scalar  name,  or  name  of
                                            array without array index).

       const char *name2 (in)               If source variable is  an  element
                                            of  an  array,  gives the index of
                                            the element.   For  scalar  source
                                            variables, is NULL.

DESCRIPTION
       Tcl_UpVar  and  Tcl_UpVar2  provide the same functionality as the upvar
       command:  they make a link from a  source  variable  to  a  destination
       variable,  so  that  references to the destination are passed transpar-
       ently through to the source.  The name of the source  variable  may  be
       specified  either  as  a single string such as xyx or a(24) (by calling
       Tcl_UpVar) or in two parts where the array name has been separated from
       the  element  name  (by  calling Tcl_UpVar2).  The destination variable
       name is specified in a single string;  it may not be an array  element.

       Both  procedures  return  either TCL_OK or TCL_ERROR, and they leave an
       error message in the interpreter's result if an error occurs.

       As with the upvar command, the source variable need not  exist;  if  it
       does exist, unsetting it later does not destroy the link.  The destina-
       tion variable may exist at the time of the call,  but  if  so  it  must
       exist as a linked variable.
