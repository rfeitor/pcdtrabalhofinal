NAME
       APR::BucketAlloc - Perl API for Bucket Allocation

Synopsis
         use APR::BucketAlloc ();
         $ba = APR::BucketAlloc->new($pool);
         $ba->destroy;

Description
       "APR::BucketAlloc" is used for bucket allocation.

       "new"

       Create an "APR::BucketAlloc" object:

         $ba = APR::BucketAlloc->new($pool);

       class: "APR::BucketAlloc"
       arg1: $pool ( "APR::Pool object" )
           The pool used to create this object.

       ret: $ba ( "APR::BucketAlloc object" )
           The new object.

       since: 2.0.00

       This bucket allocation list (freelist) is used to create new buckets
       (via "APR::Bucket->new") and bucket brigades (via "APR::Brigade->new").

       You only need to use this method if you aren't running under httpd.  If
       you are running under mod_perl, you already have a bucket allocation
       available via "$c->bucket_alloc" and "$bb->bucket_alloc".

       Example:

         use APR::BucketAlloc ();
         use APR::Pool ();
         my $ba = APR::BucketAlloc->(APR::Pool->pool);
         my $eos_b = APR::Bucket::eos_create($ba);

       "destroy"

       Destroy an "APR::BucketAlloc object":

         $ba->destroy;

       arg1: $ba ( "APR::BucketAlloc object" )
           The freelist to destroy.

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       Once destroyed this object may not be used again.

       You need to destroy $ba only if you have created it via
       "APR::BucketAlloc->new". If you try to destroy an allocation not
       created by this method, you will get a segmentation fault.

       Moreover normally it is not necessary to destroy allocators, since the
       pool which created them will destroy them during that pool's cleanup
       phase.
