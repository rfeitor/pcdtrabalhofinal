NAME
       APR::ThreadRWLock - Perl API for APR thread read/write locks

Synopsis
         use APR::ThreadRWLock ();

         my $mutex = APR::ThreadRWLock->new($r->pool);
         $mutex->rdlock;
         $mutex->wrlock;
         $mutex->tryrdlock;
         $mutex->trywrlock;
         $mutex->unlock;

Description
       "APR::ThreadRWLock" interfaces APR thread read/write locks.

       See srclib/apr/locks/unix/thread_rwlock.c in your Apache source tree.
       At the time of this writing these methods are not supported on all
       platforms. Thus, check your libraries!

API
       "APR::ThreadRWLock" provides the following functions and/or methods:

Unsupported API
       "APR::ThreadRWLock" also provides auto-generated Perl interface for a
       few other methods which aren't tested at the moment and therefore their
       API is a subject to change. These methods will be finalized later as a
       need arises. If you want to rely on any of the following methods please
       contact the the mod_perl development mailing list so we can help each
       other take the steps necessary to shift the method to an officially
       supported API.

       "DESTROY"

       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Destroy the lock and free the associated memory.

         $lock->DESTROY();

       obj: $lock ( "APR::ThreadRWLock object" )
           the lock to destroy.

       ret: no return value
       since: subject to change

       "rdlock"

       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Acquire the read lock for the given lock. The calling thread acquires
       the read lock if a writer does not hold the lock and there are  no
       writers blocked on the lock. Otherwize it is put to sleep until these
       conditions are met.

         $ret = $lock->rdlock();

       obj: $lock ( "APR::ThreadRWLock object" )
           the lock on which to acquire the lock.

       ret: $ret ( integer )
       since: subject to change

       "tryrdlock"

       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Performs the same operation as "rdlock" with the exception that the
       function shall fail if the thread would be blocked.

         $ret = $lock->tryrdlock();

       obj: $lock ( "APR::ThreadRWLock object" )
           the lock on which to acquire the lock.

       ret: $ret ( integer )
       since: subject to change

       "wrlock"

       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Acquire the write lock for the given lock. The calling thread acquires
       the write lock if if no other thread (reader or writer) holds it.
       Otherwize it is put to sleep until this condition is met.

         $ret = $lock->wrlock();

       obj: $lock ( "APR::ThreadRWLock object" )
           the lock on which to acquire the lock.

       ret: $ret ( integer )
       since: subject to change

       "trywrlock"

       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Performs the same operation as "wrlock" with the exception that the
       function shall fail if the thread would be blocked.

         $ret = $lock->trywrlock();

       obj: $lock ( "APR::ThreadRWLock object" )
           the lock on which to acquire the lock.

       ret: $ret ( integer )
       since: subject to change

       "new"

       Create a new lock

         my $lock = APR::ThreadRWLock->new($p);

       obj: "APR::ThreadRWLock" ( class name )
       arg1: $p ( "APR::Pool object" )
       ret: $lock ( "APR::ThreadRWLock object" )
       since: subject to change

       "pool_get"

       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       META: should probably be renamed to pool(), like all other pool
       accessors

       Get the pool used by this thread_lock.

         $ret = $obj->pool_get();

       obj: $obj ( "APR::ThreadRWLock object" )
       ret: $ret ( "APR::Pool object" )
           apr_pool_t the pool

       since: subject to change

       "unlock"

       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

         $ret = $lock->unlock();

       obj: $lock ( "APR::ThreadRWLock object" )
           the lock from which to release the lock.
