NAME
       Apache2::Resource - Limit resources used by httpd children

Synopsis
         PerlModule Apache2::Resource
         # set child memory limit in megabytes
         # default is 64 Meg
         PerlSetEnv PERL_RLIMIT_DATA 32:48

         # linux does not honor RLIMIT_DATA
         # RLIMIT_AS (address space) will work to limit the size of a process
         PerlSetEnv PERL_RLIMIT_AS 32:48

         # set child cpu limit in seconds
         # default is 360 seconds
         PerlSetEnv PERL_RLIMIT_CPU 120

         PerlChildInitHandler Apache2::Resource

Description
       "Apache2::Resource" uses the "BSD::Resource" module, which uses the C
       function "setrlimit" to set limits on system resources such as memory
       and cpu usage.

       Any "RLIMIT" operation available to limit on your system can be set by
       defining that operation as an environment variable with a "PERL_"
       prefix.  See your system "setrlimit" manpage for available resources
       which can be limited.

       The following limit values are in megabytes: "DATA", "RSS", "STACK",
       "FSIZE", "CORE", "MEMLOCK"; all others are treated as their natural
       unit.

       If the value of the variable is of the form "S:H", "S" is treated as
       the soft limit, and "H" is the hard limit.  If it is just a single
       number, it is used for both soft and hard limits.

Defaults
       To set reasonable defaults for all RLIMITs, add this to your
       httpd.conf:

         PerlSetEnv PERL_RLIMIT_DEFAULTS On
         PerlModule Apache2::Resource
