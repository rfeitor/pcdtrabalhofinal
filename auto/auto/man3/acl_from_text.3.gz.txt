ACL_FROM_TEXT(3)         BSD Library Functions Manual         ACL_FROM_TEXT(3)

NAME
     acl_from_text -- create an ACL from text

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     acl_t
     acl_from_text(const char *buf_p);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_from_text() function converts the text form of an ACL referred to
     by buf_p into the internal working structure for ACLs, appropriate for
     applying to files or manipulating.

     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free
     any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
     acl_free(3) with the (void *)acl_t as an argument.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     The ACL_TYPE_EXTENDE text format differs from the POSIX.1e format, and
     this function will not translate between formats.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, the function shall return a pointer to the
     internal representation of the ACL in working storage.  Otherwise, a
     value of (acl_t)NULL shall be returned, and errno shall be set to indi-
     cate the error.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_from_text() function
     shall return a value of (acl_t)NULL and set errno to the corresponding
     value:

     [EINVAL]           Argument buf_p cannot be translated into an ACL.

     [ENOMEM]           The ACL working storage requires more memory than is
                        allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory man-
                        agement constraints.
