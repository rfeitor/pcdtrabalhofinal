NAME
       Apache2::ConnectionUtil - Perl API for Apache connection utils

Synopsis
          use Apache2::Connection     ();
          use Apache2::ConnectionUtil ();
          use Apache2::RequestRec     ();

          # grab the connection object;
          my $c = $r->connection;

          # share perl objects like $r->pnotes
          $old_val = $c->pnotes($key => $value);

Description
       "Apache2::ConnectionUtil" provides the Apache connection record object
       utilities API.

API
       "Apache2::ConnectionUtil" provides the following functions and/or
       methods:

       "pnotes"

       Share Perl variables between requests over the lifetime of the
       connection.

          $old_val  = $c->pnotes($key => $val);
          $val      = $c->pnotes($key);
          $hash_ref = $c->pnotes();

       obj: $c ( "Apache2::Connection object" )
       opt arg1: $key ( string )
           A key value

       opt arg2: $val ( SCALAR )
           Any scalar value (e.g. a reference to an array)

       ret: (3 different possible values)
           if both, $key and $val are passed the previous value for $key is
           returned if such existed, otherwise undef is returned.

           if only $key is passed, the current value for the given key is
           returned.

           if no arguments are passed, a hash reference is returned, which can
           then be directly accessed without going through the "pnotes()"
           interface.

       since: 2.0.3

       See ("Apache2::RequestUtil::pnotes") for the details of the "pnotes"
       method usage.  The usage is identical except for a few differences.
       First is the use of $c instead of $r as the invocant.  The second is
       that the the data persists for the lifetime of the connection instead
       of the lifetime of the request.  If the connection is lost, so is the
       data stored in "pnotes".
