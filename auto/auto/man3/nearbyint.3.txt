NEARBYINT(3)             BSD Library Functions Manual             NEARBYINT(3)

NAME
     nearbyint -- round to integral value in floating-point format

SYNOPSIS
     #include <math.h>

     double
     nearbyint(double x);

     long double
     nearbyintl(long double x);

     float
     nearbyintf(float x);

DESCRIPTION
     The nearbyint() functions return the integral value (represented as a
     double precision number) nearest to x according to the prevailing round-
     ing mode.

     nearbyint() is the same as rint(), except that nearbyint is guaranteed
     never to set floating point flags or trigger floating point exceptions
     (which are disabled by default).  rint() is typically much more perfor-
     mant than nearbyint() if the application does not depend on flags being
     preserved.

SPECIAL VALUES
     nearbyint(+-0) returns +-0 for all rounding modes.

     nearbyint(+-infinity) returns +-infinity for all rounding modes.

STANDARDS
     The nearbyint() functions conform to ISO/IEC 9899:1999(E).
