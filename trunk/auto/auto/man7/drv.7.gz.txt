NAME
       drv - cups driver interface for ppd compiler files

SYNOPSIS
       drv list
       drv cat drv:///filename.drv/pcfilename

DESCRIPTION
       drv   lists   and   compiles   PPDC   source  files  installed  in  the
       /usr/share/cups/drv  and  (on  Mac  OS  X)  /Library/Printers/PPDs/Con-
       tents/Resources directories on behalf of the scheduler, cupsd(8).

       The  first  form  of the command lists all of the PPD files that can be
       produced by the driver information files in the two directories.

       The second form of the command compiles the requested PPD and sends  it
       to the standard output.
