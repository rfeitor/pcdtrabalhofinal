NAME
       smbcacls - Set or get ACLs on an NT file or directory names

SYNOPSIS
       smbcacls  {//server/share}  {filename}  [-D acls]  [-M acls]  [-a acls]
        [-S acls] [-C name] [-G name] [--numeric] [-t] [-U username] [-h] [-d]

DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       The  smbcacls program manipulates NT Access Control Lists (ACLs) on SMB
       file shares.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available to the smbcacls program. The format
       of ACLs is described in the section ACL FORMAT

       -a acls
          Add  the  ACLs  specified  to  the ACL list. Existing access control
          entries are unchanged.

       -M acls
          Modify the mask value (permissions) for the ACLs  specified  on  the
          command  line.  An error will be printed for each ACL specified that
          was not already present in the ACL list

       -D acls
          Delete any ACLs specified on the command  line.  An  error  will  be
          printed  for  each ACL specified that was not already present in the
          ACL list.

       -S acls
          This command sets the ACLs on the file with only the ones  specified
          on  the  command  line. All other ACLs are erased. Note that the ACL
          specified must contain at least a revision, type,  owner  and  group
          for the call to succeed.

       -U username
          Specifies  a  username used to connect to the specified service. The
          username may be of the form "username" in which  case  the  user  is
          prompted  to  enter in a password and the workgroup specified in the
          smb.conf(5) file is  used,  or  "username%password"  or  "DOMAINser-
          name%password" and the password and workgroup names are used as pro-
          vided.

       -C name
          The owner of a file or directory can be changed to  the  name  given
          using  the -C option. The name can be a sid in the form S-1-x-y-z or
          a name resolved against the server specified in the first  argument.

          This command is a shortcut for -M OWNER:name.

       -G name
          The  group  owner  of a file or directory can be changed to the name
          given using the -G option. The name can be a sid in the form  S-1-x-
          y-z  or  a  name  resolved  against the server specified n the first
          argument.

          This command is a shortcut for -M GROUP:name.

       --numeric
          This option displays all ACL  information  in  numeric  format.  The
          default  is  to  convert  SIDs to names and ACE types and masks to a
          readable string format.

       -t
          Don't actually do anything, only validate  the  correctness  of  the
          arguments.

       -h|--help
          Print a summary of command line options.

       -V
          Prints the program version number.

       -s <configuration file>
          The  file  specified  contains the configuration details required by
          the server. The information in this  file  includes  server-specific
          information  such  as what printcap file to use, as well as descrip-
          tions of all the  services  that  the  server  is  to  provide.  See
          smb.conf  for  more information. The default configuration file name
          is determined at compile time.

       -d|--debuglevel=level
          level is an integer from 0 to 10. The default value if this  parame-
          ter is not specified is zero.

          The  higher  this  value,  the more detail will be logged to the log
          files about the activities of the server. At level 0, only  critical
          errors  and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable
          level for day-to-day running - it generates a small amount of infor-
          mation about operations carried out.

          Levels  above  1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
          should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are
          designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
          data, most of which is extremely cryptic.

          Note that specifying this parameter here will override the

          parameter in the smb.conf file.

       -l|--logfile=logdirectory
          Base directory name for log/debug files. The  extension  ".progname"
          will  be  appended  (e.g.  log.smbclient, log.smbd, etc...). The log
          file is never removed by the client.

ACL FORMAT
       The format of an ACL is one or more ACL  entries  separated  by  either
       commas or newlines. An ACL entry is one of the following:





       REVISION:<revision number>
       OWNER:<sid or name>
       GROUP:<sid or name>
       ACL:<sid or name>:<type>/<flags>/<mask>



       The  revision of the ACL specifies the internal Windows NT ACL revision
       for the security descriptor. If not specified it defaults to  1.  Using
       values other than 1 may cause strange behaviour.

       The owner and group specify the owner and group sids for the object. If
       a SID in the format S-1-x-y-z is specified this is used, otherwise  the
       name specified is resolved using the server on which the file or direc-
       tory resides.

       ACLs specify permissions granted to the SID.  This  SID  again  can  be
       specified in S-1-x-y-z format or as a name in which case it is resolved
       against the server on which the file or directory  resides.  The  type,
       flags  and mask values determine the type of access granted to the SID.

       The type can be either 0 or 1 corresponding to ALLOWED or DENIED access
       to  the  SID.  The  flags  values  are generally zero for file ACLs and
       either 9 or 2 for directory ACLs. Some common flags are:

       +  #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_OBJECT_INHERIT 0x1

       +  #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_CONTAINER_INHERIT 0x2

       +  #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_NO_PROPAGATE_INHERIT 0x4

       +  #define SEC_ACE_FLAG_INHERIT_ONLY 0x8

       At present flags can only be specified as decimal or  hexadecimal  val-
       ues.

       The  mask  is  a  value which expresses the access right granted to the
       SID. It can be given as a decimal or hexadecimal value, or by using one
       of  the  following text strings which map to the NT file permissions of
       the same name.

       +  R - Allow read access

       +  W - Allow write access

       +  X - Execute permission on the object

       +  D - Delete the object

       +  P - Change permissions

       +  O - Take ownership

       The following combined permissions can be specified:

       +  READ - Equivalent to 'RX' permissions

       +  CHANGE - Equivalent to 'RXWD' permissions

       +  FULL - Equivalent to 'RWXDPO' permissions

EXIT STATUS
       The smbcacls program sets the exit status depending on the  success  or
       otherwise  of  the  operations performed. The exit status may be one of
       the following values.

       If the operation succeeded, smbcacls returns and exit status of  0.  If
       smbcacls  couldn't  connect  to  the  specified server, or there was an
       error getting or setting the ACLs, an exit status of 1 is returned.  If
       there  was  an error parsing any command line arguments, an exit status
       of 2 is returned.

VERSION
       This man page is correct for version 3.0 of the Samba suite.

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were  created  by
       Andrew  Tridgell.  Samba  is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open
       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.

       smbcacls was written by Andrew Tridgell and Tim Potter.

       The conversion to DocBook for Samba 2.2 was done by Gerald Carter.  The
       conversion  to  DocBook  XML  4.2  for  Samba 3.0 was done by Alexander
       Bokovoy.
