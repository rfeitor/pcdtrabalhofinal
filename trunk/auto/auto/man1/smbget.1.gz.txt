DESCRIPTION
       This tool is part of the samba(7) suite.

       smbget is a simple utility with wget-like semantics, that can  download
       files  from  SMB  servers.  You can specify the files you would like to
       download on the command-line.

       The   files   should   be   in   the   smb-URL   standard,   e.g.   use
       smb://host/share/file for the UNC path \\HOST\SHARE\file.

OPTIONS
       -a, --guest
          Work as user guest

       -r, --resume
          Automatically resume aborted files

       -R, --recursive
          Recursively download files

       -u, --username=STRING
          Username to use

       -p, --password=STRING
          Password to use

       -w, --workgroup=STRING
          Workgroup to use (optional)

       -n, --nonprompt
          Don't ask anything (non-interactive)

       -d, --debuglevel=INT
          Debuglevel to use

       -D, --dots
          Show dots as progress indication

       -P, --keep-permissions
          Set same permissions on local file as are set on remote file.

       -o, --outputfile
          Write the file that is being download to the specified file. Can not
          be used together with -R.

       -f, --rcfile
          Use specified rcfile. This will be loaded in the order it was speci-
          fied  -  e.g. if you specify any options before this one, they might
          get overriden by the contents of the rcfile.

       -q, --quiet
          Be quiet

       -v, --verbose
          Be verbose

       -b, --blocksize
          Number of bytes to download in a block. Defaults to 64000.

       -?, --help
          Show help message

       --usage
          Display brief usage message

SMB URLS
       SMB URL's should be specified in the following format:





       smb://[[[domain;]user[:password@]]server[/share[/path[/file]]]]







       smb:// means all the workgroups







       smb://name/ means, if name is a workgroup, all the servers in this workgroup, or if name is a server, all the shares on this server.



EXAMPLES
       # Recursively download 'src' directory
       smbget -R smb://rhonwyn/jelmer/src
       # Download FreeBSD ISO and enable resuming
       smbget -r smb://rhonwyn/isos/FreeBSD5.1.iso
       # Recursively download all ISOs
       smbget -Rr smb://rhonwyn/isos
       # Backup my data on rhonwyn
       smbget -Rr smb://rhonwyn/


BUGS
       Permission denied is returned in some cases  where  the  cause  of  the
       error  is  unknown (such as an illegally formatted smb:// url or trying
       to get a directory without -R turned on).

AUTHOR
       The original Samba software  and  related  utilities  were  created  by
       Andrew  Tridgell.  Samba  is now developed by the Samba Team as an Open
       Source project similar to the way the Linux kernel is developed.

       The smbget manpage was written by Jelmer Vernooij.
