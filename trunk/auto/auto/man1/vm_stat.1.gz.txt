VM_STAT(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               VM_STAT(1)

NAME
     vm_stat -- show Mach virtual memory statistics

SYNOPSIS
     vm_stat [interval]

DESCRIPTION
     vm_stat displays Mach virtual memory statistics.  If the optional
     interval is specified, then vm_stat will display the statistics every
     interval seconds.  In this case, each line of output displays the change
     in each statistic (an interval count of 1 displays the values per sec-
     ond).  However, the first line of output following each banner displays
     the system-wide totals for each statistic.  The following values are dis-
     played:

     Pages free
             the total number of free pages in the system.

     Pages active
             the total number of pages currently in use and pageable.

     Pages inactive
             the total number of pages on the inactive list.

     Pages wired down
             the total number of pages wired down.  That is, pages that cannot
             be paged out.

     Translation faults
             the number of times the "vm_fault" routine has been called.

     Pages copy-on-write
             the number of faults that caused a page to be copied (generally
             caused by copy-on-write faults).

     Pages zero filled
             the total number of pages that have been zero-filled on demand.

     Pages reactivated
             the total number of pages that have been moved from the inactive
             list to the active list (reactivated).

     Pageins
             the number of requests for pages from a pager (such as the inode
             pager).

     Pageouts
             the number of pages that have been paged out.

     If interval is not specified, then vm_stat displays all accumulated sta-
     tistics along with the page size and the object cache performance.
