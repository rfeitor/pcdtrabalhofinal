SPKAC(1)                            OpenSSL                           SPKAC(1)



NAME
       spkac - SPKAC printing and generating utility

SYNOPSIS
       openssl spkac [-in filename] [-out filename] [-key keyfile] [-passin
       arg] [-challenge string] [-pubkey] [-spkac spkacname] [-spksect
       section] [-noout] [-verify] [-engine id]

DESCRIPTION
       The spkac command processes Netscape signed public key and challenge
       (SPKAC) files. It can print out their contents, verify the signature
       and produce its own SPKACs from a supplied private key.

COMMAND OPTIONS
       -in filename
           This specifies the input filename to read from or standard input if
           this option is not specified. Ignored if the -key option is used.

       -out filename
           specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by
           default.

       -key keyfile
           create an SPKAC file using the private key in keyfile. The -in,
           -noout, -spksect and -verify options are ignored if present.

       -passin password
           the input file password source. For more information about the
           format of arg see the PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS section in openssl(1).

       -challenge string
           specifies the challenge string if an SPKAC is being created.

       -spkac spkacname
           allows an alternative name form the variable containing the SPKAC.
           The default is "SPKAC". This option affects both generated and
           input SPKAC files.

       -spksect section
           allows an alternative name form the section containing the SPKAC.
           The default is the default section.

       -noout
           don't output the text version of the SPKAC (not used if an SPKAC is
           being created).

       -pubkey
           output the public key of an SPKAC (not used if an SPKAC is being
           created).

       -verify
           verifies the digital signature on the supplied SPKAC.

       -engine id
           specifying an engine (by it's unique id string) will cause req to
           attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
           thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the
           default for all available algorithms.

EXAMPLES
       Print out the contents of an SPKAC:

        openssl spkac -in spkac.cnf

       Verify the signature of an SPKAC:

        openssl spkac -in spkac.cnf -noout -verify

       Create an SPKAC using the challenge string "hello":

        openssl spkac -key key.pem -challenge hello -out spkac.cnf

       Example of an SPKAC, (long lines split up for clarity):

        SPKAC=MIG5MGUwXDANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAANLADBIAkEA1cCoq2Wa3Ixs47uI7F\
        PVwHVIPDx5yso105Y6zpozam135a8R0CpoRvkkigIyXfcCjiVi5oWk+6FfPaD03u\
        PFoQIDAQABFgVoZWxsbzANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQQFAANBAFpQtY/FojdwkJh1bEIYuc\

        4=

NOTES
       A created SPKAC with suitable DN components appended can be fed into
       the ca utility.

       SPKACs are typically generated by Netscape when a form is submitted
       containing the KEYGEN tag as part of the certificate enrollment
       process.

       The challenge string permits a primitive form of proof of possession of
       private key. By checking the SPKAC signature and a random challenge
       string some guarantee is given that the user knows the private key
       corresponding to the public key being certified. This is important in
       some applications. Without this it is possible for a previous SPKAC to
       be used in a "replay attack".
