NFSSTAT(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               NFSSTAT(1)

NAME
     nfsstat -- display NFS statistics

SYNOPSIS
     nfsstat [-cseu] [-w wait] [-n net|user]

DESCRIPTION
     nfsstat displays statistics kept about NFS client and server activity,
     active user activity, and exported directories.  In the absence of any
     options, nfsstat displays NFS client and server statistics.

     The options are as follows:

     -c      Show NFS client statistics.

     -e      Show exported directory statistics.

     -s      Show NFS server statistics.

     -u      Show active user statistics.

     -w      Display a shorter summary at wait second intervals.

     -n net|user
             Show network addresses as numbers, or show users as uid numbers.
             This option can appear multiple times.

     Server Info:
         Statistics for the NFS server.

         RPC Counts
             Counts of RPC calls on each of the NFS server's procedures are

         Server Faults
             Errors in the NFS server.

         Server Cache Stats

             Inprog
                  Calls already in progress.

             Idem
                  Cache hits for idempotent procedures.

             Non-idem
                  Cache hits for non-idempotent procedures.

             Misses
                  Cache Misses.

         Server Write Gathering
             These statistics describe the efficiency of the NFS server's
             write gathering feature.

             WriteOps
                  Write operations to disk.

             WriteRPC
