PRAUDIT(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               PRAUDIT(1)

NAME
     praudit -- print the contents of audit trail files

SYNOPSIS
     praudit [-lpx] [-r | -s] [-d del] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The praudit utility prints the contents of the audit trail files to the
     standard output in human-readable form.  If no file argument is speci-
     fied, the standard input is used by default.

     The options are as follows:

     -d del  Specifies the delimiter.  The default delimiter is the comma.

     -l      Prints the entire record on the same line.  If this option is not
             specified, every token is displayed on a different line.

     -p      Specify this option if input to praudit is piped from the tail(1)
             utility.  This causes praudit to sync to the start of the next
             record.

     -r      Prints the records in their raw, numeric form.  This option is
             exclusive from -s.

     -s      Prints the tokens in their short form.  Short text representa-
             tions for record and event type are displayed.  This option is
             exclusive from -r.

     -x      Print audit records in the XML output format.

     If the raw or short forms are not specified, the default is to print the
     tokens in their long form.  Events are displayed as per their descrip-
     tions given in /etc/security/audit_event; UIDs and GIDs are expanded to
     their names; dates and times are displayed in human-readable format.
