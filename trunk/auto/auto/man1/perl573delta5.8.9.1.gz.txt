Changes
       This is just a selected list of some of the more notable changes.  The
       numbers refer to the Perl repository change numbers; see Changes58 (or
       Changes in Perl 5.8.1).  In addition to these changes, lots of work
       took place in integrating threads, PerlIO, and Unicode; general code
       cleanup; and last but not least porting to non-UNIX lands such as
       Win32, VMS, Cygwin, DJGPP, VOS, MacOS Classic, and EBCDIC.

Reporting Bugs
       If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
       recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
       database at http://bugs.perl.org.  There may also be information at
       http://www.perl.com/, the Perl Home Page.

       If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug pro-
       gram included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a
       tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output
       of "perl -V", will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
       the Perl porting team.
