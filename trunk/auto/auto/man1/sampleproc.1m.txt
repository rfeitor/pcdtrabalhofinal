sampleproc(1m)                   USER COMMANDS                  sampleproc(1m)



NAME
       sampleproc - sample processes on the CPUs. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       sampleproc [hertz]

DESCRIPTION
       This program samples which process is on each CPU, at a particular con-
       figurable rate. This can be used as an estimate for  which  process  is
       consuming the most CPU time.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Sample at 100 hertz,
              # sampleproc

       Sample at 400 hertz,
              # sampleproc 400
