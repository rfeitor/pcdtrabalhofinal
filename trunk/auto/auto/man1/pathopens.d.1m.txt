pathopens.d(1m)                  USER COMMANDS                 pathopens.d(1m)



NAME
       pathopens.d - full pathnames opened ok count. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       pathopens.d

DESCRIPTION
       This program prints a count of the number of times files have been suc-
       cessfully opened. This is somewhat special in that the full pathname is
       calculated, even if the file open referred to a relative pathname.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       This samples until Ctrl-C is hit.
              # pathopens.d


FIELDS
       PATHNAME
              full pathname

       COUNT  number of successful opens


DOCUMENTATION
       See the DTraceToolkit for further documentation under the  Docs  direc-
       tory. The DTraceToolkit docs may include full worked examples with ver-
       bose descriptions explaining the output.

EXIT
       pathopens.d will sample until Ctrl-C is hit.
