YPWHICH(1)                BSD General Commands Manual               YPWHICH(1)

NAME
     ypwhich -- return hostname of YP server of map master

SYNOPSIS
     ypwhich [-d domain] [[-t] -m [mname] | host]
     ypmatch -x

DESCRIPTION
     Ypmatch tells which YP server supplies YP services to a client, or which
     is the master for a map.  If invoked without arguments, it gives the YP
     server for the local machine.  If host is specified, that machine is
     queried to find out which YP server it is using.

     The options are as follows:

     -d domain
             Specify a domain other than the default domain.

     -t      Inhibit translation of map nicknames to their corresponding map
             names.

     -m [mname]
             Find the master YP server for the named map.  No host may be
             specified with the -m option.  Mname can be a map name or nick-
             name.  If mname is ommitted, ypwhich will produce a list of
             available maps.

     -x      Display the map nickname table.
