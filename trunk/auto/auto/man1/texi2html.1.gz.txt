NAME
       texi2html - a Texinfo to HTML converter

SYNOPSIS
       texi2html [options] file

DESCRIPTION
       Texi2html  converts  the  given Texinfo file to a set of HTML files. It
       tries to handle most of the  Texinfo  commands.  It  creates  hypertext
       links for cross-references, footnotes...

       Texi2html  may furthermore use latex2html to generate HTML (code and/or
       images) for @math and @iftex tags (see the --l2h option).

       Texi2html creates several files depending on the contents of  the  Tex-
       info file and on the chosen options (see FILES).

       The HTML files created by texi2html are closer to TeX than to Info.

OPTIONS
       Options may be abbreviated to th shortests unique prefix. The following
       is only an incomplete list of the available options:

       --help [1|2]
                   Print usage instructions and list the most  important,  all
                   relevant,  or  all recognised (including obsolete) command-
                   line options, and exit.

       --ifinfo --iftex --ifxml --ifplaintext --ifhtml
                   Expand @ifinfo, @iftex and @tex, @ifxml and @xml, @ifplain-
                   text,  @ifhtml  and  @html regions, and don't expand @ifnot
                   corresponding regions (default: ifhtml).

       --no-ifinfo --no-iftex --no-ifxml --no-ifplaintext --no-html
                   Don't expand @ifinfo, @iftex, @ifxml, @ifplaintext  regions
                   and expand @ifnot corresponding regions.

       -I dir      Append  dir  to  the  directory  list searched for included
                   files.

       -P dir      Prepend dir to the directory  list  searched  for  included
                   files.

       --no-menu   Don't show the Texinfo menus; by default they are shown.

       --no-number Don't number the sections.

       --split chapter|section|node
                   Split  the  output  into  several  HTML files (one per main
                   chapter/section or node).

       --l2h       Use latex2html for content of @math and @tex tags.  Content
                   must  be  such  that  both, latex and tex, can translate it
                   correctly. I.e., no tex-only constructs must be used.

       --l2h-l2h prog
                   Use prog as latex2html program (default latex2html).   Pro-
                   gram must be executable.

       --l2h-init file
                   Use  file  as  latex2html init file. file should be used to
                   specify  in  which  way  latex2html  handles   mathematical
                   expressions and formulas.

                   Note  that  latex2html locates (and uses) init-files in the
                   following order (provided they exist): (1) global init file
                   (usually      in     latex2html     source     dir)     (2)
                   $HOME/.latex2html_init (3) ./.latex2html_init (4) init file
                   given on command line.

       --l2h-tmp dir
                   Use  dir  as  tmp dir for latex2html. This directory (resp.
                   its path) must not contain a dot  (i.e., a ".").

       --l2h-clean remove all intermediate files generated by latex2html (pre-
                   vents caching!)

       --l2h-skip  Do  not really run latex2html. Use (kept) files of previous
                   runs, instead.

       --Verbose   Give a verbose output.

       --version   Print version and exit.


FILES
       Initialisation options are read first from ${prefix}/etc/texi2html/Con-
       fig  (the  exact  location  being  changeable with the --sysconfdir=dir
       option to the configure  script),  then  from  $HOME/.texi2html/Config,
       then any command-line options including --init-file options; with later
       settings overriding earlier ones.

       By default texi2html my creates the following files (foo being the name
       of the Texinfo file):

       foo_toc.html    The table of contents (if @contents is present).

       foo.html        The document's contents or the Top element.

       foo_fot.html    The footnotes (if any).

       foo_abt.html    An help section.

       foo_l2h_img*    Images generated by latex2html (if any).

       When  used  with  the --split option, it creates several files (one per
       chapter or node), named foo_n.html (n being the index of the chapter or
       node), and the foo.html file contains the Top element.

       Otherwise it creates only one file: foo.html
