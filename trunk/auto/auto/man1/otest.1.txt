otest(1)                  BSD General Commands Manual                 otest(1)

NAME
     otest -- SenTestingKit, OCUnit.

SYNOPSIS
     otest [-SenTest Self | All | None | <TestCaseClassName/testMethodName>]
           path

DESCRIPTION
     otest runs the unit tests found in the bundle given at path.

ARGUMENTS
     -SenTest value  This flag denotes the scope of the unit test to be run.
                     Possible values are Self, All, None and <TestCaseClass-
                     Name/testMethodName>. The default value is Self.

     path            Path to the bundle that contains the unit tests.

OBJECTIVE-C GARBAGE COLLECTION
     otest is built with support for Objective-C garbage collection.  Due to
     the "whole process" nature of Objective-C garbage collection, invoking
     otest from the command line or an IDE or debugger will run otest with
     garbage collection enabled.  Doing so requires that the bundle containing
     the unit tests also be built with support for garbage collection.

     To avoid this requirement and disable garbage collection, run otest in an
     environment with the OBJC_DISABLE_GC environment variable set to YES.

ENVIRONMENT
     OBJC_DISABLE_GC  Set to YES to disable Objective-C garbage collection for
                      otest when running test bundles that do not use it.

FILES
     /Developer/Tools/RunTargetUnitTests  A script that calls otest with the
                                          correct arguments for use with
                                          Xcode.
