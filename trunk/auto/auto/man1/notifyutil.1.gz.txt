NAME
     notifyutil -- notification command line utility

SYNOPSIS
     notifyutil [-q] [-v] [-t] [-p key] [-w key] [-# key] [-g key]
                [-s key val] ...

DESCRIPTION
     notifyutil is a command-line utility for interacting with the notifyd(8)
     notification server.  It may be used to post notifications, detect and
     report notifications, and to examine and set the state value associated
     with a notification key.

     The following table summarizes the actions that may be performed.

           -p key      Post a notification for key.
           -w key      Register for key and wait for notifications.
           -# key      Register for key and wait for # (an integer) notifica-
                       tions.  E.g. -1 key waits for a single notification.
           -g key      Get state value for key.
           -s key val  Set state value for key.

     When invoked with any combination of -w and -# actions, notifyutil regis-
     ters for notification for the specified key(s).  If any key is given with
     a -w action, notifyutil runs until interrupted with Control-C.  If all
     registrations are invoked with -#, the program continues to run until the
     corresponding number of notifications for each key have been received.

     When a notification for any key that is being monitored is received,
     notifyutil prints the key on a single line on its standard output.  The
     -v (verbose), -t (time stamp), and -q (quiet) flags, if specified, modify
     the output behavior.  The -v flag causes notifyutil to print both the key
     and the current state value for that key.  The -t flag causes notifyutil
     to print a time stamp preceeding the notification key.  The -q flag
     causes notifyutil to operate silently.

     notifyutil processes its command-line arguments from left to right.  For
     example, the following will register for a single notification for the
     key ``test.abc'' and then post a notification for that key.

           notifyutil -1 test.abc -p test.abc
