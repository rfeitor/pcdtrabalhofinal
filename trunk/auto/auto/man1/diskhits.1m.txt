NAME
       diskhits - disk access by file offset. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       diskhits pathname

DESCRIPTION
       This  prints  how  a file was accessed, the locations on a distribution
       plot.  This is for the cache misses  only  -  the  file  activity  that
       resulted in disk events.

       Since  this  uses  DTrace, only users with root privileges can run this
       command.

              # diskhits /var/adm/messages
