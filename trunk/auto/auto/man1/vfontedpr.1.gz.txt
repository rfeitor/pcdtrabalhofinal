VGRIND(1)                 BSD General Commands Manual                VGRIND(1)

NAME
     vgrind -- grind nice listings of programs

SYNOPSIS
     vgrind [-] [-W] [-d file] [-f] [-h header] [-l language] [-n] [-sn] [-t]
            [-x] name ...

DESCRIPTION
     vgrind formats the program sources which are arguments in a nice style
     using troff(1).  Comments are placed in italics, keywords in bold face,
     and the name of the current function is listed down the margin of each
     page as it is encountered.

     vgrind runs in two basic modes, filter mode (see the -f option) or regu-
     lar mode.  In filter mode vgrind acts as a filter in a manner similar to
     tbl(1).  The standard input is passed directly to the standard output
     except for lines bracketed by the troff-like macros:

     .vS     starts processing

     .vE     ends processing

     These lines are formatted as described above.  The output from this fil-
     ter can be passed to troff for output.  There need be no particular
     ordering with eqn(1) or tbl(1).

     In regular mode vgrind accepts input files, processes them, and passes
     them to troff(1) for output.

     In both modes vgrind passes any lines beginning with a decimal point
     without conversion.

     The options are:

     -             forces input to be taken from standard input (default if -f
                   is specified )

     -d file       specifies an alternative language definitions file (default
                   is /usr/share/misc/vgrindefs)

     -f            forces filter mode

     -h header     specifies a particular header to put on every output page
                   (default is the file name)

     -l            specifies the language to use.  Currently known are PASCAL
                   (-lp), MODEL (-lm), C (-lc or the default), CSH (-lcsh),
                   SHELL (-lsh), RATFOR (-lr), MODULA2 (-lmod2), YACC
                   (-lyacc), LISP (-lisp), and ICON (-lI).

     -n            forces no keyword bolding

     -s            specifies a point size to use on output (exactly the same
                   as the argument of a .ps)

     -t            similar to the same option in troff causing formatted text
                   to go to the standard output

     -W            forces output to the (wide) Versatec printer rather than
                   the (narrow) Varian

     -x            outputs the index file in a ``pretty'' format.  The index
                   file itself is produced whenever vgrind is run with a file
                   called index in the current directory.  The index of func-
                   tion definitions can then be run off by giving vgrind the
                   -x option and the file index as argument.

FILES
     index                        file where source for index is created
     /usr/share/tmac/tmac.vgrind  macro package
     /usr/libexec/vfontedpr       preprocessor
     /usr/share/misc/vgrindefs    language descriptions

SEE ALSO

BUGS
     Vfontedpr assumes that a certain programming style is followed:

     For C - function names can be preceded on a line only by spaces, tabs, or
     an asterisk.  The parenthesized arguments must also be on the same line.

     For PASCAL - function names need to appear on the same line as the key-
     words function or procedure.

     For MODEL - function names need to appear on the same line as the key-
     words is beginproc.

     If these conventions are not followed, the indexing and marginal function
     name comment mechanisms will fail.

     More generally, arbitrary formatting styles for programs mostly look bad.
     The use of spaces to align source code fails miserably; if you plan to
     vgrind your program you should use tabs.  This is somewhat inevitable
     since the font used by vgrind is variable width.

     The mechanism of ctags(1) in recognizing functions should be used here.

     Filter mode does not work in documents using the -me or -ms macros.  (So
     what use is it anyway?)

HISTORY
     The vgrind command appeared in 3.0BSD.
