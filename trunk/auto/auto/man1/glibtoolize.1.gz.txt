GLIBTOOL(1)               BSD General Commands Manual              GLIBTOOL(1)

NAME
     glibtool, glibtoolize -- generic shared library support

SYNOPSIS
     glibtool [arguments]
     glibtoolize [arguments]

DESCRIPTION
     glibtool and glibtoolize are scripts that provide generic shared library
     support to package developers.  It is actually the GNU libtool and
     libtoolize scripts, renamed to avoid conflict with the Apple-provided
     libtool(1).

     As of version 1.5.22, better Mac OS X support is provided.  The -arch,
     -framework and -isysroot options are now passed to the compiler/linker as
     would be expected.  Bundles can be built using the --undefined
     dynamic_lookup link option, if the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment
     variable is set to 10.3 or greater.

     The rest of this manual page describes the additional features added to
     glibtool for Mac OS X.  More general documentation is listed below.
