httpdstat.d(1m)                  USER COMMANDS                 httpdstat.d(1m)



NAME
       httpdstat.d - realtime httpd statistics. Uses DTrace.

SYNOPSIS
       httpdstat.d [interval [count]]

DESCRIPTION
       This  prints connection statistics for "httpd" processes, such as those
       from an Apache web server.

       Since this uses DTrace, only users with root privileges  can  run  this
       command.

EXAMPLES
       Print statistics every second,
              # httpdstat.d

       Print every 5 seconds, 6 times,
              # httpdstat.d 5 6


FIELDS
       TIME   time, string

       NUM    number of connections

       GET    number of GETs

       POST   number of POSTs

       HEAD   number of HEADs

       TRACE  number of TRACEs


NOTES
       All statistics are printed as a value per interval.

       This version does not process subsequent operations on keepalives.


IDEA
       Ryan Matteson (who first wrote a solution to this).
