DESCRIPTION
       Please see Alien for the manifesto of the Alien namespace.

       In short "Alien::wxWidgets" can be used to detect and get configuration
       settings from an installed wxWidgets.

METHODS
       load/import

           use Alien::wxWidgets version          => 2.004 | [ 2.004, 2.005 ],
                                compiler_kind    => 'gcc' | 'cl', # Windows only
                                compiler_version => '3.3', # only GCC for now
                                toolkit          => 'gtk2',
                                debug            => 0 | 1,
                                unicode          => 0 | 1,
                                mslu             => 0 | 1,
                                key              => $key,
                                ;

           Alien::wxWidgets->load( <same as the above> );

       Using "Alien::wxWidgets" without parameters will load a default
       configuration (for most people this will be the only installed
       confiuration). Additional parameters allow to be more selective.

       If there is no matching configuration the method will "die()".

       In case no arguments are passed in the "use", "Alien::wxWidgets" will
       try to find a reasonable default configuration.

       Please note that when the version is pecified as "version =" 2.004> it
       means "any version >= 2.004" while when specified as "version =" [
       2.004, 2.005 ]> it means "any version => 2.004 and < 2.005".

       key

           my $key = Alien::wxWidgets key;

       Returns an unique key that can be used to reload the currently-loaded
       configuration.

       version

           my $version = Alien::wxWidgets->version;

       Returns the wxWidgets version for this "Alien::wxWidgets" installation
       in the form MAJOR + MINOR / 1_000 + RELEASE / 1_000_000 e.g. 2.006002
       for wxWidgets 2.6.2 and 2.004 for wxWidgets 2.4.0.

       config

           my $config = Alien::wxWidgets->config;

       Returns some miscellaneous configuration informations for wxWidgets in
       the form

           { toolkit   => 'msw' | 'gtk' | 'motif' | 'x11' | 'cocoa' | 'mac',
             debug     => 1 | 0,
             unicode   => 1 | 0,
             mslu      => 1 | 0,
             }

       include_path

           my $include_path = Alien::wxWidgets->include_path;

       Returns the include paths to be used in a format suitable for the
       compiler (usually something like "-I/usr/local/include
       -I/opt/wx/include").

       defines

           my $defines = Alien::wxWidgets->defines;

       Returns the compiler defines to be used in a format suitable for the
       compiler (usually something like "-D__WXDEBUG__ -DFOO=bar").

       c_flags

           my $cflags = Alien::wxWidgets->c_flags;

       Returns additional compiler flags to be used.

       compiler

           my $compiler = Alien::wxWidgets->compiler;

       Returns the (C++) compiler used for compiling wxWidgets.

       linker

           my $linker = Alien::wxWidgets->linker;

       Returns a linker suitable for linking C++ binaries.

       link_flags

           my $linkflags = Alien::wxWidgets->link_flags;

       Returns additional link flags.

       libraries

           my $libraries = Alien::wxWidgets->libraries( qw(gl adv core base) );

       Returns link flags for linking the libraries passed as arguments. This
       usually includes some search path specification in addition to the
       libraries themselves. The caller is responsible for the correct order
       of the libraries.

       link_libraries

           my @libraries = Alien::wxWidgets->link_libraries( qw(gl adv core base) );

       Returns a list of linker flags that can be used to link the libraries
       passed as arguments.

       import_libraries

           my @implib = Alien::wxWidgets->import_libraries( qw(gl adv core base) );

       Windows specific. Returns a list of import libraries corresponding to
       the libraries passed as arguments.

       shared_libraries

           my @shrlib = Alien::wxWidgets->shared_libraries( qw(gl adv core base) );

       Returns a list of shared libraries corresponding to the libraries
       passed as arguments.

       library_keys

           my @keys = Alien::wxWidgets->library_keys;

       Returns a list of keys that can be passed to "shared_libraries",
       "import_libraries" and "link_libraries".

       library_path

           my $library_path = Alien::wxWidgets->shared_library_path;

       Windows specific. Returns the path at which the private copy of
       wxWidgets libraries has been installed.

       prefix

           my $prefix = Alien::wxWidgets->prefix;

       Returns the install prefix for wxWidgets.

       dump_configurations

           Alien::wxWidgets->dump_configurations( %filters );

       Prints a list of available configurations (mainly useful for
       interactive use/debugging).

       show_configurations

           Alien::wxWidgets->show_configurations( %filters );

       Prints a human-readable list of available configurations (mainly useful
       for interactive use/debugging).

       get_configurations

          my $configs = Alien::wxWidgets->get_configurations( %filters );

       Returns a list of configurations matching the given filters.
