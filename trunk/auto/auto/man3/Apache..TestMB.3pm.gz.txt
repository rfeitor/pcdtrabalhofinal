NAME
       Apache::TestMB - Subclass of Module::Build to support Apache::Test

SYNOPSIS
       Standard process for building & installing modules:

         perl Build.PL
         ./Build
         ./Build test
         ./Build install

       Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the
       "./" notation, you can do this:

         perl Build.PL
         perl Build
         perl Build test
         perl Build install

DESCRIPTION
       This class subclasses "Module::Build" to add support for testing Apache
       integration with Apache::Test. It is broadly based on "Apache::TestMM",
       and as such adds a number of build actions to a the Build script, while
       simplifying the process of creating Build.PL scripts.

       Here's how to use "Apache::TestMB" in a Build.PL script:

         use Module::Build;

         my $build_pkg = eval { require Apache::TestMB }
             ? 'Apache::TestMB' : 'Module::Build';

         my $build = $build_pkg->new(
             module_name => 'My::Module',
         );
         $build->create_build_script;

       This is identical to how "Module::Build" is used. Not all target
       systems may have "Apache::Test" (and therefore "Apache::TestMB"
       installed, so we test for it to be installed, first. But otherwise, its
       use can be exactly the same. Consult the Module::Build documentation
       for more information on how to use it; Module::Build::Cookbook may be
       especially useful for those looking to migrate from
       "ExtUtils::MakeMaker".

INTERFACE
       Build

       With the above script, users can build your module in the usual
       "Module::Build" way:

         perl Build.PL
         ./Build
         ./Build test
         ./Build install

       If "Apache::TestMB" is installed, then Apache will be started before
       tests are run by the "test" action, and shut down when the tests
       complete. Note that "Build.PL" can be called "Apache::Test"-specific
       options in addition to the usual "Module::Build" options. For example:

         perl Build.PL -apxs /usr/local/apache/bin/apxs

       Consult the Apache::Test documentation for a complete list of options.

       In addition to the actions provided by "Module::Build" ("build",
       "clean", "code", "test", etc.), "Apache::TestMB" adds a few extra
       actions:

       test_clean
           This action cleans out the files generated by the test script,
           t/TEST. It is also executed by the "clean" action.

       run_tests
           This action actually the tests by executing the test script,
           t/TEST. It is executed by the "test" action, so most of the time it
           won't be executed directly.

       testcover
           "Apache::TestMB" overrides this action from "Module::Build" in
           order to prevent the "Apache::Test" preference files from being
           included in the test coverage.

       Constructor

       new

       The "new()" constructor takes all the same arguments as its parent in
       "Module::Build", but can optionally accept one other parameter:

       apache_test_script
           The name of the "Apache::Test" test script. The default value is
           t/TEST, which will work in the vast majority of cases. If you wish
           to specify your own file name, do so with a relative file name
           using Unix-style paths; the file name will automatically be
           converted for the local platform.

       When "new()" is called it does the following:

       +   Processes the "Apache::Test"-specific options in @ARGV. See the
           Apache::Test documentation for a complete list of options.

       +   Sets the name of the "Apache::Test" test script to t/TEST, unless
           it was explicitly specified by the "apache_test_script" parameter.

       +   Calls "generate_script()" to generate "Apache::Test" test script,
           usually t/TEST.

       Instance Methods

       apache_test_args

       Returns a hash reference containing all of the settings specified by
       options passed to Build.PL, or explicitly added to @ARGV in Build.PL.
       Consult the Apache::Test documentation for a complete list of options.

       apache_test_script

       Gets or sets the file name of the "Apache::Test" test script.

       generate_script

         $build->generate_script;
         $build->generate_script('t/FOO');
         $build->generate_script(undef, 'Apache::TestRun');

       This method is called by "new()", so in most cases it can be ignored.
       If you'd like it to use other than the default arguments, you can call
       it explicitly in Build.PL and pass it the arguments you desire. It
       takes two optional arguments:

       +   The name of the "Apache::Test" test script. Defaults to the value
           returned by "apache_test_script()".

       +   The name of an "Apache::Test" test running class. Defaults to
           "Apache::TestRunPerl".

       If there is an existing t/TEST.PL (or a script with the same name as
       specified by the "apache_test_script" parameter but with .PL appended
       to it), then that script will be used as the template for the test
       script.  Otherwise, a simple test script will be written similar to
       what would be written by "Apache::TestRun::generate_script()" (although
       that function is not aware of the arguments passed to Build.PL, so use
       this one instead!).

           This article by Geoffrey Young explains how to configure Apache and
           write tests for your module using Apache::Test. Just use
           "Apache::TestMB" instead of "Apache::TestMM" to update it for use
           with "Module::Build".
