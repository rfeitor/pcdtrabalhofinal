NAME
       Net::LDAP::Control::Paged - LDAPv3 Paged results control object

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::LDAP;
        use Net::LDAP::Control::Paged;
        use Net::LDAP::Constant qw( LDAP_CONTROL_PAGED );

        $ldap = Net::LDAP->new( "ldap.mydomain.eg" );

        $page = Net::LDAP::Control::Paged->new( size => 100 );

        @args = ( base     => "cn=subnets,cn=sites,cn=configuration,$BASE_DN",
                  scope    => "subtree",
                  filter   => "(objectClass=subnet)",
                  callback => \&process_entry, # Call this sub for each entry
                  control  => [ $page ],
        );

        my $cookie;
        while(1) {
          # Perform search
          my $mesg = $ldap->search( @args );

          # Only continue on LDAP_SUCCESS
          $mesg->code and last;

          # Get cookie from paged control
          my($resp)  = $mesg->control( LDAP_CONTROL_PAGED ) or last;
          $cookie    = $resp->cookie or last;

          # Set cookie in paged control
          $page->cookie($cookie);
        }

        if ($cookie) {
          # We had an abnormal exit, so let the server know we do not want any more
          $page->cookie($cookie);
          $page->size(0);
          $ldap->search( @args );
        }

DESCRIPTION
       "Net::LDAP::Control::Paged" provides an interface for the creation and
       manipulation of objects that represent the "pagedResultsControl" as
       described by RFC-2696.

CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS
       In addition to the constructor arguments described in
       Net::LDAP::Control the following are provided.

       cookie
           The value to use as the cookie. This is not normally set when an
           object is created, but is set from the cookie value returned by the
           server. This associates a search with a previous search, so the
           server knows to return the page of entries following the entries it
           returned the previous time.

       size
           The page size that is required. This is the maximum number of
           entries that the server will return to the search request.

METHODS
       As with Net::LDAP::Control each constructor argument described above is
       also avaliable as a method on the object which will return the current
       value for the attribute if called without an argument, and set a new
       value for the attribute if called with an argument.
