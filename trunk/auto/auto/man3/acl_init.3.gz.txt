ACL_INIT(3)              BSD Library Functions Manual              ACL_INIT(3)

NAME
     acl_init -- initialize ACL working storage

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/acl.h>

     acl_t
     acl_init(int count);

DESCRIPTION
     The acl_init() function allocates and initializes the working storage for
     an ACL of at least count ACL entries.  A pointer to the working storage
     is returned.  The working storage allocated to contain the ACL is freed
     by a call to acl_free(3).  When the area is first allocated, it shall
     contain an ACL that contains no ACL entries.

     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free
     any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
     acl_free(3) with the (void*)acl_t as an argument.

RETURN VALUES
     Upon successful completion, this function shall return a pointer to the
     working storage.  Otherwise, a value of (acl_t)NULL shall be returned,
     and errno shall be set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
     If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_init() function shall
     return a value of (acl_t)NULL and set errno to the corresponding value:

     [EINVAL]           The value of count is less than zero.

     [ENOMEM]           The acl_t to be returned requires more memory than is
                        allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory man-
                        agement constraints.
