NAME
       sasl_server_step - Perform a step in the authentication negotiation



SYNOPSIS
       #include <sasl/sasl.h>

       int sasl_server_step(sasl_conn_t *conn,
                           const char *clientin,
                           unsigned clientinlen,
                        const char ** serverout,
                           unsigned * serveroutlen);



DESCRIPTION
       sasl_server_step()  performs  a step in the authentication negotiation.
       It returns SASL_OK if the whole negotiation is sucessful and  SASL_CON-
       TINUE if this step is ok but at least one more step is needed.


       conn is the SASL connection context

       clientin  is  the  data  given  by  the client (decoded if the protocol
       encodes requests sent over the wire) clientinlen is the length of  cli-
       entin

       serverout and serveroutlen are set by the library and should be sent to
       the client.


RETURN VALUE
       sasl_server_step returns an integer which corresponds  to  one  of  the
       SASL  error  codes.  SASL_CONTINUE  indicates sucess and that there are
       more steps needed in the authentication.  SASL_OK  indicates  that  the
       authentication  is complete. All other return codes indicate errors and
       should either be handled or the authentication session should be  quit.
