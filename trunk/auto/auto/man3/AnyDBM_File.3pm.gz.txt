AnyDBM_File(3pm)       Perl Programmers Reference Guide       AnyDBM_File(3pm)



NAME
       AnyDBM_File - provide framework for multiple DBMs

       NDBM_File, DB_File, GDBM_File, SDBM_File, ODBM_File - various DBM
       implementations

SYNOPSIS
           use AnyDBM_File;

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a "pure virtual base class"--it has nothing of its own.
       It's just there to inherit from one of the various DBM packages.  It
       prefers ndbm for compatibility reasons with Perl 4, then Berkeley DB
       (See DB_File), GDBM, SDBM (which is always there--it comes with Perl),
       and finally ODBM.   This way old programs that used to use NDBM via
       dbmopen() can still do so, but new ones can reorder @ISA:

           BEGIN { @AnyDBM_File::ISA = qw(DB_File GDBM_File NDBM_File) }
           use AnyDBM_File;

       Having multiple DBM implementations makes it trivial to copy database
       formats:

           use POSIX; use NDBM_File; use DB_File;
           tie %newhash,  'DB_File', $new_filename, O_CREAT|O_RDWR;
           tie %oldhash,  'NDBM_File', $old_filename, 1, 0;
           %newhash = %oldhash;

           is often shunned.

       [1] Can be trimmed if you compile for one access method.
