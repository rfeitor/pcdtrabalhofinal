NAME
       border, wborder, box, hline, whline, vline, wvline, mvhline, mvwhline,
       mvvline, mvwvline - create curses borders, horizontal and vertical
       lines

SYNOPSIS
       #include <curses.h>
       int border(chtype ls, chtype rs, chtype ts, chtype bs,
          chtype tl, chtype tr, chtype bl, chtype br);
       int wborder(WINDOW *win, chtype ls, chtype rs,
          chtype ts, chtype bs, chtype tl, chtype tr,
          chtype bl, chtype br);
       int box(WINDOW *win, chtype verch, chtype horch);
       int hline(chtype ch, int n);
       int whline(WINDOW *win, chtype ch, int n);
       int vline(chtype ch, int n);
       int wvline(WINDOW *win, chtype ch, int n);
       int mvhline(int y, int x, chtype ch, int n);
       int mvwhline(WINDOW *, int y, int x, chtype ch, int n);
       int mvvline(int y, int x, chtype ch, int n);
       int mvwvline(WINDOW *, int y, int x, chtype ch, int n);

DESCRIPTION
       The  border,  wborder and box routines draw a box around the edges of a
       window.  Other than the window, each argument is a character  with  at-
       tributes:

              ls - left side,
              rs - right side,
              ts - top side,
              bs - bottom side,
              tl - top left-hand corner,
              tr - top right-hand corner,
              bl - bottom left-hand corner, and
              br - bottom right-hand corner.

       If  any of these arguments is zero, then the corresponding default val-
       ues (defined in curses.h) are used instead:

              ACS_VLINE,
              ACS_VLINE,
              ACS_HLINE,
              ACS_HLINE,
              ACS_ULCORNER,
              ACS_URCORNER,
              ACS_LLCORNER,
              ACS_LRCORNER.

       box(win, verch, horch) is a shorthand for  the  following  call:  wbor-
       der(win, verch, verch, horch, horch, 0, 0, 0, 0).

       The  hline  and whline functions draw a horizontal (left to right) line
       using ch starting at the current cursor position in  the  window.   The
       current  cursor position is not changed.  The line is at most n charac-
       ters long, or as many as fit into the window.

       The vline and wvline functions draw a vertical (top to bottom) line us-
       ing ch starting at the current cursor position in the window.  The cur-
       rent cursor position is not changed.  The line is at most n  characters
       long, or as many as fit into the window.

RETURN VALUE
       All  routines return the integer OK.  The SVr4.0 manual says "or a non-
       negative integer if immedok is set", but this appears to be an error.

       X/Open does not define any error conditions.  This  implementation  re-
       turns an error if the window pointer is null.

NOTES
       The  borders  generated  by these functions are inside borders (this is
       also true of SVr4 curses, though the fact is not documented).

       Note that border and box may be macros.

PORTABILITY
       These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.  The
       standard  specifies  that  they return ERR on failure, but specifies no
       error conditions.
