NAME
       DBD::Gofer::Transport::stream - DBD::Gofer transport for stdio
       streaming

SYNOPSIS
         DBI->connect('dbi:Gofer:transport=stream;url=ssh:username@host.example.com;dsn=dbi:...',...)

       or, enable by setting the DBI_AUTOPROXY environment variable:

         export DBI_AUTOPROXY='dbi:Gofer:transport=stream;url=ssh:username@host.example.com'

DESCRIPTION
       Without the "url=" parameter it launches a subprocess as

         perl -MDBI::Gofer::Transport::stream -e run_stdio_hex

       and feeds requests into it and reads responses from it. But that's not
       very useful.

       With a "url=ssh:username@host.example.com" parameter it uses ssh to
       launch the subprocess on a remote system. That's much more useful!

       It gives you secure remote access to DBI databases on any system you
       can login to.  Using ssh also gives you optional compression and many
       other features (see the ssh manual for how to configure that and many
       other options via ~/.ssh/config file).

       The actual command invoked is something like:

         ssh -xq ssh:username@host.example.com bash -c $setup $run

       where $run is the command shown above, and $command is

         . .bash_profile 2>/dev/null || . .bash_login 2>/dev/null || . .profile 2>/dev/null; exec "$@"

       which is trying (in a limited and fairly unportable way) to setup the
       environment (PATH, PERL5LIB etc) as it would be if you had logged in to
       that system.

       The ""perl"" used in the command will default to the value of $^X when
       not using ssh.  On most systems that's the full path to the perl that's
       currently executing.

PERSISTENCE
       Currently gofer stream connections persist (remain connected) after all
       database handles have been disconnected. This makes later connections
       in the same process very fast.

       Currently up to 5 different gofer stream connections (based on url) can
       persist.  If more than 5 are in the cache when a new connection is made
       then the cache is cleared before adding the new connection. Simple but
       effective.

TO DO
       Document go_perl attribute

       Automatically reconnect (within reason) if there's a transport error.

       Decide on default for persistent connection - on or off? limits? ttl?
